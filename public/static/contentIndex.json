You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\nSuggested Characteristics\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d8Personality Trait1I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example.2I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.3I see omens in every event and action.

A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for `1d4` hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.\n \n***Probing Telepathy.*** If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature&#039;s greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.\n \n***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature&#039;s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can&#039;t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (`1d12`) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.\n \n***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`3d6 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.\n \n***Enslave (3/Day).*** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) target is under the aboleth&#039;s control and can&#039;t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.\n \nWhenever the [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Detect.*** The aboleth makes a Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.\n \n***Tail Swipe.*** The aboleth makes one tail attack.\n \n***Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).*** One creature [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the aboleth takes 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.\n \n## Lair actions\n \nWhen fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n \n- The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) on this effect, the aboleth can&#039;t take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth&#039;s phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.  \n- Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). The aboleth can&#039;t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.  \n- Water in the aboleth&#039;s lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature&#039;s rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) psychic damage. The aboleth can&#039;t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing an aboleth&#039;s lair is warped by the creature&#039;s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth&#039;s lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.  \n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.  \n- As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration), as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image&#039;s position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.  \n \nIf the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of `3d10` days.\n\nEnvironment\nunderdark"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/aberration/chuul":{"title":"chuul","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/underdark","monster/size/large","monster/type/aberration"],"content":"Chuul\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Chuul\n![](compendium/bestiary/aberration/token/chuul.png#token)\n*Large aberration, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 16  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 93 (`11d10 + 33`)\n- **Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|19 (+4)|10 (+0)|16 (+3)| 5 (-3)|11 (+0)| 5 (-3)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** ⏤\n- **Skills** Perception +4\n- **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14\n- **Damage Immunities** poison\n- **Condition Immunities** poisoned\n- **Languages** understands Deep Speech but can&#039;t speak\n- **Challenge** 4\n \n## Traits\n \n***Amphibious.*** The chuul can breathe air and water.\n \n***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will.

If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.\n \n***Pincer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. The target is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn&#039;t have two other creatures [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled).\n \n***Tentacles.*** One creature [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed).

If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target&#039;s head, and the target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.\n \n***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage.\n \n***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn&#039;t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of the cloaker&#039;s next turn. If a creature&#039;s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker&#039;s moan for the next 24 hours.\n \n***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn&#039;t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\n \nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can&#039;t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\n \nA duplicate has the cloaker&#039;s AC and uses its saving throws.

Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured.

Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.  \n- Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over `1d10` days.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Ennui.** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair are filled with listless despair.  \n- **Grating Spies.** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.

The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) and buried. The buried target is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.  \n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#039;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) lightning damage.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-blue-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md)) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Misleading Mirage.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50% chance chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.  \n- **Sudden Sinkhole.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and landing [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary blue dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.  \n- Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#039;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).  \n- Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#039;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall `1d6 × 10` feet into the sinkhole.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within `1d10` days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Blue Luster.** Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.  \n- **Mirage Terrain.** The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis.

Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished.  \n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute.

Each of these statues briefly animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus to hit and dealing 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit.  \n- **Blast of Wind.** A mighty wind sweeps through the lair in a direction of the dragon&#039;s choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the wind&#039;s direction and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished. If the dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15 feet in the wind&#039;s direction, and the wind can&#039;t knock the dragon [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n- **Obscuring Sand.** Dust and sand fill the air within 120 feet of the dragon, making the area lightly obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary brass dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.  \n- Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it&#039;s an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.  \n- Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature&#039;s presence and location.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the tracks fade in `1d10` days, but the other effects fade immediately.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Cloud Companion.** A small, wispy cloud follows non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair. It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of &quot;extreme heat&quot; (see the &quot;Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide&quot;).  \n- **Talkative Denizens.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices.

On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the dragon.  \n \n***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon&#039;s choice).\n \nIn a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.\n \n***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.\n \n***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings.

The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) thunder damage and be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#deafened) until the end of its next turn.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-bronze-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-bronze-dragon.md)) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Ocean&#039;s Call.** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) slashing damage.  \n- **Whelming Water.** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary bronze dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic.\n \n- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can&#039;t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can&#039;t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute.

Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the [spike growth](compendium/spells/spike-growth.md) spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  \n- The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-copper-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-copper-dragon.md)) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Laughing Gas.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it.

These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can&#039;t divulge its whereabouts.  \n- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of `1d10` days. The other effects end immediately.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Either of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Distant Melodies.** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- **Starlit Stones.** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair.

It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.  \n- Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Beneficent Trail.** Within 10 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- **Emanation of Justice.** Creatures that spend a year within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair value fairness and justice over their personal feelings.  \n- **Liar&#039;s Revelation.** Within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the truth it was attempting to conceal.

That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  \n- A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (`4d8`) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#039;s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall&#039;s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#039;s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (`4d8`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  \n- Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-green-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-green-dragon.md)) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Creeper Vines.** The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become [zombies](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.  \n- **Lashing Root.** One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary green dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- **.** Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#039;s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (`1d6`) piercing damage from thorns.  \n \n    Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.  \n- Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon&#039;s path.  \n- Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair serve as the dragon&#039;s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within `1d10` days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Either or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Inviting Whispers.** Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.  \n- **Twisted Messengers.** The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature&#039;s throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon&#039;s own in order to allow the dragon&#039;s voice to issue forth.  \n\nEnvironment\nforest"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon":{"title":"adult-red-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/hill","monster/environment/mountain","monster/size/huge","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Adult Red Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Adult Red Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/adult-red-dragon.png#token)\n*Huge dragon, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 19  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 256 (`19d12 + 133`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., climb 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|27 (+8)|10 (+0)|25 (+7)|16 (+3)|13 (+1)|21 (+5)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +6\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +6, Constitution +13, Wisdom +7, Charisma +11\n- **Skills** Perception +13, Stealth +6\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 23\n- **Damage Immunities** fire\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 17\n \n## Traits\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Each creature in the geyser&#039;s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of its turn. While [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-red-dragon.md)) red dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Noxious Smoke.** A cloud of thick, dark smoke fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature other than the dragon that starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of its turn. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- **Searing Heat.** Searing heat spreads out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature that enters the affected area or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The heat lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary red dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.  \n- Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a red dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Desertification.** Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, making the land parched and arid and most plant life withered and brown.  \n- **Fiery Senses.** The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any open flame within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- **Ominous Flames.** Open flames within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair are tinged dark red, hiss and crackle constantly, and throw off embers and showers of sparks.  \n\nEnvironment\nmountain, hill"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon":{"title":"adult-silver-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/mountain","monster/environment/urban","monster/size/huge","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Adult Silver Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Adult Silver Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/adult-silver-dragon.png#token)\n*Huge dragon, Lawful Good*\n \n- **Armor Class** 19  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 243 (`18d12 + 126`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|27 (+8)|10 (+0)|25 (+7)|16 (+3)|13 (+1)|21 (+5)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +5\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +5, Constitution +12, Wisdom +6, Charisma +10\n- **Skills** Arcana +8, History +8, Perception +11, Stealth +5\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 21\n- **Damage Immunities** cold\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 16\n \n## Traits\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n \n***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n \n## Additional sources\n \n \n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n \n- The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the [fog cloud](compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished.  \n \n**Additional Lair Action.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-silver-dragon.md)) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:\n \n- **Icy Grip.** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon.

The dragon doesn&#039;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell.  \n- Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon&#039;s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.  \n- Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in `1d10` days.\n\nEnvironment\nmountain, urban"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon":{"title":"adult-white-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/arctic","monster/size/huge","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Adult White Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Adult White Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/adult-white-dragon.png#token)\n*Huge dragon, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 18  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 200 (`16d12 + 96`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|22 (+6)|10 (+0)|22 (+6)| 8 (-1)|12 (+1)|12 (+1)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +5\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +5, Constitution +11, Wisdom +6, Charisma +6\n- **Skills** Perception +11, Stealth +5\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 21\n- **Damage Immunities** cold\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 13\n \n## Traits\n \n***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check.

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (`3d6`) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  \n- Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage.  \n- The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#039;s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- **Whirling Wind.** A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the &quot;Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide&quot; for rules on &quot;strong wind&quot;). The dragon&#039;s flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary white dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.  \n- Icy walls block off areas in the dragon&#039;s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.  \n- If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of `1d10` days.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Biting Chill.** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair (see the &quot;Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide&quot; for rules on &quot;extreme cold&quot;). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.  \n- **Mirror Ice.** The icy surfaces in the dragon&#039;s lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50% chance chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.  \n\nEnvironment\narctic"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon":{"title":"ancient-black-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/swamp","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient Black Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient Black Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-black-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 22  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 367 (`21d20 + 147`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|27 (+8)|14 (+2)|25 (+7)|16 (+3)|15 (+2)|19 (+4)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +7\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +9, Constitution +14, Wisdom +9, Charisma +11\n- **Skills** Perception +16, Stealth +9\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 26\n- **Damage Immunities** acid\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 21\n \n## Traits\n \n***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n \n## Additional sources\n \n \n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can&#039;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n \n- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage.  \n- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [darkvision](rules/senses.md#darkvision) can&#039;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#039;t illuminate it. If any of the effect&#039;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md)) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Filth Burst.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is &quot;difficult terrain&quot;.  \n- **Grasping Muck.** Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon&#039;s lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon&#039;s choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- **Noxious Gas.** A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary black dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.  \n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.  \n- Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over `1d10` days.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Ennui.** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair are filled with listless despair.  \n- **Grating Spies.** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.  \n- **Rotting Domain.** Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.  \n\nEnvironment\nswamp"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon":{"title":"ancient-blue-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/coastal","monster/environment/desert","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient Blue Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient Blue Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-blue-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Lawful Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 22  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 481 (`26d20 + 208`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., burrow 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|29 (+9)|10 (+0)|27 (+8)|18 (+4)|17 (+3)|21 (+5)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +7\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +7, Constitution +15, Wisdom +10, Charisma +12\n- **Skills** Perception +17, Stealth +7\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 27\n- **Damage Immunities** lightning\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 23\n \n## Traits\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) and buried. The buried target is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.  \n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair&#039;s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) lightning damage.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-blue-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md)) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Misleading Mirage.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50% chance chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.  \n- **Sudden Sinkhole.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and landing [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary blue dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.  \n- Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can&#039;t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).  \n- Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon&#039;s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall `1d6 × 10` feet into the sinkhole.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within `1d10` days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Blue Luster.** Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.  \n- **Mirage Terrain.** The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.  \n- **Sandstorm.** A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n\nEnvironment\ndesert, coastal"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-brass-dragon":{"title":"ancient-brass-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/desert","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient Brass Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient Brass Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-brass-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Chaotic Good*\n \n- **Armor Class** 20  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 297 (`17d20 + 119`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., burrow 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|27 (+8)|10 (+0)|25 (+7)|16 (+3)|15 (+2)|19 (+4)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +6\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +6, Constitution +13, Wisdom +8, Charisma +10\n- **Skills** History +9, Perception +14, Persuasion +10, Stealth +6\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 24\n- **Damage Immunities** fire\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 20\n \n## Traits\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Each creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (`16d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.  \n \n***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon&#039;s choice).\n \nIn a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.\n \n***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.\n \n***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n \n## Additional sources\n \n \n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n \n- A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished.  \n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-brass-dragon.md)) brass dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Animate Statues.** The dragon chooses up to three statues in the lair that it can see. Each of these statues briefly animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus to hit and dealing 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit.  \n- **Blast of Wind.** A mighty wind sweeps through the lair in a direction of the dragon&#039;s choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the wind&#039;s direction and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished. If the dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15 feet in the wind&#039;s direction, and the wind can&#039;t knock the dragon [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n- **Obscuring Sand.** Dust and sand fill the air within 120 feet of the dragon, making the area lightly obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary brass dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.  \n- Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it&#039;s an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.  \n- Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature&#039;s presence and location.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the tracks fade in `1d10` days, but the other effects fade immediately.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Cloud Companion.** A small, wispy cloud follows non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair. It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of &quot;extreme heat&quot; (see the &quot;Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide&quot;).  \n- **Talkative Denizens.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices. The air is filled with a deafening chorus of birds and small animals, and sapient creatures talk extensively.  \n\nEnvironment\ndesert"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-bronze-dragon":{"title":"ancient-bronze-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/coastal","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient Bronze Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient Bronze Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-bronze-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Lawful Good*\n \n- **Armor Class** 22  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 444 (`24d20 + 192`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|29 (+9)|10 (+0)|27 (+8)|18 (+4)|17 (+3)|21 (+5)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +7\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +7, Constitution +15, Wisdom +10, Charisma +12\n- **Skills** Insight +10, Perception +17, Stealth +7\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 27\n- **Damage Immunities** lightning\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 22\n \n## Traits\n \n***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (`16d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- **Repulsion Breath.** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the dragon.  \n \n***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon&#039;s choice).\n \nIn a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.\n \n***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.\n \n***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (`2d6 + 9`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n \n## Additional sources\n \n \n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n \n- The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the [fog cloud](compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) thunder damage and be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#deafened) until the end of its next turn.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-bronze-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-bronze-dragon.md)) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Ocean&#039;s Call.** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.  \n- **Salt Burst.** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) slashing damage.  \n- **Whelming Water.** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary bronze dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic.\n \n- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#039;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell.  \n- Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.  \n- Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in `1d10` days.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Phantom Escort.** Ghostly naval ships from an ancient armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon&#039;s help toward the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- **Underwater Pursuit.** Sailors glimpse the shadowy, illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with their vessel.  \n- **Unfailing Faithfulness.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair find it nearly impossible to break a promise.  \n\nEnvironment\ncoastal"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-copper-dragon":{"title":"ancient-copper-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/hill","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient Copper Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient Copper Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-copper-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Chaotic Good*\n \n- **Armor Class** 21  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 350 (`20d20 + 140`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., climb 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|27 (+8)|12 (+1)|25 (+7)|20 (+5)|17 (+3)|19 (+4)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +7\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +8, Constitution +14, Wisdom +10, Charisma +11\n- **Skills** Deception +11, Perception +17, Stealth +8\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 27\n- **Damage Immunities** acid\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 21\n \n## Traits\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&#039;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon&#039;s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\n \n***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.\n \n- **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (`14d8`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can&#039;t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can&#039;t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.  \n \n***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon&#039;s choice).\n \nIn a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.\n \n***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.\n \n***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n \n## Additional sources\n \n \n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n \n- The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the [spike growth](compendium/spells/spike-growth.md) spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  \n- The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-copper-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-copper-dragon.md)) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Laughing Gas.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with laughter until the end of its next turn.  \n- **Torpid Energy.** The dragon chooses a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can&#039;t use reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary copper dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Magic carvings of the dragon&#039;s smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can&#039;t divulge its whereabouts.  \n- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of `1d10` days. The other effects end immediately.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Either of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Distant Melodies.** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- **Starlit Stones.** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. The stones shed dim light in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain, but they no longer shed light.)  \n\nEnvironment\nhill"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon":{"title":"ancient-gold-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/forest","monster/environment/grassland","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient Gold Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient Gold Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-gold-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Lawful Good*\n \n- **Armor Class** 22  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 546 (`28d20 + 252`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|30 (+10)|14 (+2)|29 (+9)|18 (+4)|17 (+3)|28 (+9)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +7\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +9, Constitution +16, Wisdom +10, Charisma +16\n- **Skills** Insight +10, Perception +17, Persuasion +16, Stealth +9\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 27\n- **Damage Immunities** fire\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 24\n \n## Traits\n \n***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon&#039;s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round.

The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.  \n- Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair. The mist doesn&#039;t obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.  \n- Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Beneficent Trail.** Within 10 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- **Emanation of Justice.** Creatures that spend a year within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair value fairness and justice over their personal feelings.  \n- **Liar&#039;s Revelation.** Within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the truth it was attempting to conceal.

That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  \n- A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (`4d8`) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#039;s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall&#039;s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#039;s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (`4d8`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  \n- Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-green-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-green-dragon.md)) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Creeper Vines.** The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become [zombies](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.  \n- **Lashing Root.** One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary green dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- **.** Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it&#039;s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (`1d6`) piercing damage from thorns.  \n \n    Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.  \n- Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon&#039;s path.  \n- Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon&#039;s lair serve as the dragon&#039;s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it.

The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.  \n- **Twisted Messengers.** The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 67 (`15d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n \n***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon&#039;s choice).\n \nIn a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.\n \n***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.\n \n***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (`2d6 + 10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.\n \n## Additional sources\n \n \n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n \n- The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the [fog cloud](compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished.  \n \n**Additional Lair Action.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-silver-dragon.md)) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:\n \n- **Icy Grip.** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon. Each creature of the dragon&#039;s choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures that have resistance to cold damage have advantage on the saving throw; creatures that have immunity to cold damage succeed automatically.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary silver dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.\n \n- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn&#039;t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell.  \n- Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon&#039;s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.  \n- Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in `1d10` days.\n\nEnvironment\nmountain, urban"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon":{"title":"ancient-white-dragon","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/arctic","monster/size/gargantuan","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Ancient White Dragon\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Ancient White Dragon\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/ancient-white-dragon.png#token)\n*Gargantuan dragon, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 20  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 333 (`18d20 + 144`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft., burrow 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|26 (+8)|10 (+0)|26 (+8)|10 (+0)|13 (+1)|14 (+2)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +6\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +6, Constitution +14, Wisdom +7, Charisma +8\n- **Skills** Perception +13, Stealth +6\n- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 23\n- **Damage Immunities** cold\n- **Languages** Common, Draconic\n- **Challenge** 20\n \n## Traits\n \n***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check.

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (`3d6`) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  \n- Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage.  \n- The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall&#039;s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  \n \n**Additional Lair Actions.** At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon.md) or [ancient](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md)) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n \n- **Blinding Sleet.** Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- **Whirling Wind.** A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the &quot;Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide&quot; for rules on &quot;strong wind&quot;). The dragon&#039;s flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region containing a legendary white dragon&#039;s lair is warped by the dragon&#039;s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair.  \n- Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.  \n- Icy walls block off areas in the dragon&#039;s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.  \n- If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.  \n \nIf the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of `1d10` days.\n \n**Additional Regional Effects.** Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon&#039;s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:\n \n- **Biting Chill.** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon&#039;s lair (see the &quot;Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide&quot; for rules on &quot;extreme cold&quot;). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.  \n- **Mirror Ice.** The icy surfaces in the dragon&#039;s lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50% chance chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.  \n\nEnvironment\narctic"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/dragon/black-dragon-wyrmling":{"title":"black-dragon-wyrmling","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/size/medium","monster/type/dragon"],"content":"Black Dragon Wyrmling\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Black Dragon Wyrmling\n![](compendium/bestiary/dragon/token/black-dragon-wyrmling.png#token)\n*Medium dragon, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 17  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 33 (`6d8 + 6`)\n- **Speed** 30 ft., fly 60 ft., swim 30 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|15 (+2)|14 (+2)|13 (+1)|10 (+0)|11 (+0)|13 (+1)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +4, Constitution +3, Wisdom +2, Charisma +3\n- **Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +4\n- **Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14\n- **Damage Immunities** acid\n- **Languages** Draconic\n- **Challenge** 2\n \n## Traits\n \n***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage plus 2 (`1d4`) acid damage.\n \n***Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales acid in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide.

While [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible), she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) with her.\n \n## Lair actions\n \nThe following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag&#039;s most powerful ability.\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can&#039;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n \n- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren&#039;t there.  \n- The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.  \n \nA powerful green hag might have the following additional lair action:\n \n- The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can&#039;t take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its possession.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nEach hag&#039;s lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag&#039;s most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to `2d10` days to fade away.\n \nThe region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag&#039;s lair is warped by the creature&#039;s fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n- Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.  \n \nA powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:\n \n- Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate&#039;s space. If the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.  \n- The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.  \n- Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.  \n \n## Is copy\n \ntrue\n \n## _copied from\n \nHag (VGM)\n\nEnvironment\nforest, swamp, hill"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fey/satyr":{"title":"satyr","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/forest","monster/size/medium","monster/type/fey"],"content":"Satyr\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Satyr\n![](compendium/bestiary/fey/token/satyr.png#token)\n*Medium fey, Chaotic Neutral*\n \n- **Armor Class** 14  ([leather armor](compendium/items/leather-armor.md))\n- **Hit Points** 31 (`7d8`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|12 (+1)|16 (+3)|11 (+0)|12 (+1)|10 (+0)|14 (+2)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** ⏤\n- **Skills** Perception +2, Performance +6, Stealth +5\n- **Senses** passive Perception 12\n \n- **Languages** Common, Elvish, Sylvan\n- **Challenge** 1/2\n \n## Traits\n \n***Magic Resistance.*** The satyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`2d4 + 1`) bludgeoning damage.\n \n***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.\n \n***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.\n\nEnvironment\nforest"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fey/sea-hag":{"title":"sea-hag","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/coastal","monster/environment/underwater","monster/size/medium","monster/type/fey"],"content":"Sea Hag\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Sea Hag\n![](compendium/bestiary/fey/token/sea-hag.png#token)\n*Medium fey, Chaotic Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 14  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 52 (`7d8 + 21`)\n- **Speed** 30 ft., swim 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|16 (+3)|13 (+1)|16 (+3)|12 (+1)|12 (+1)|13 (+1)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** ⏤\n- **Skills** ⏤\n- **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\n \n- **Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant\n- **Challenge** 2\n \n## Traits\n \n***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.\n \n***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag&#039;s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&#039;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag&#039;s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\n \nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag&#039;s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw.

The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n \nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n \n## Lair actions\n \nThe following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag&#039;s most powerful ability.\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can&#039;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n \n- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren&#039;t there.  \n- The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.  \n \nA powerful sea hag might have the following additional lair actions:\n \n- The hag fills up to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. The inky areas are heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a steady, strong underwater current disperses the ink on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the obscuring effect of the ink.  \n- The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the [simulacrum](compendium/spells/simulacrum.md) spell). This hideous simulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles the creature it is imitating. This simulacrum obeys the hag&#039;s commands and is destroyed on initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nEach hag&#039;s lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag&#039;s most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to `2d10` days to fade away.\n \nThe region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag&#039;s lair is warped by the creature&#039;s fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n- Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.  \n \nA powerful sea hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:\n \n- Most surfaces are covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.  \n- Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any ability check made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these waters has disadvantage.  \n- Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish. The hag can sense when one of the fish is handled and cause it to speak with her voice.  \n \n## Is copy\n \ntrue\n \n## _copied from\n \nHag (VGM)\n\nEnvironment\nunderwater, coastal"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fey/sprite":{"title":"sprite","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/forest","monster/size/tiny","monster/type/fey"],"content":"Sprite\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Sprite\n![](compendium/bestiary/fey/token/sprite.png#token)\n*Tiny fey, Neutral Good*\n \n- **Armor Class** 15  ([leather armor](compendium/items/leather-armor.md))\n- **Hit Points** 2 (`1d4`)\n- **Speed** 10 ft., fly 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 3 (-4)|18 (+4)|10 (+0)|14 (+2)|13 (+1)|11 (+0)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** ⏤\n- **Skills** Perception +3, Stealth +8\n- **Senses** passive Perception 13\n \n- **Languages** Common, Elvish, Sylvan\n- **Challenge** 1/4\n \n## Actions\n \n***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 slashing damage.\n \n***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute.

The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\n \nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag&#039;s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).\n \n***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag&#039;s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n \n**At will**: [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md)\n \n**2/day each**: [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only), [ray of enfeeblement](compendium/spells/ray-of-enfeeblement.md), [sleep](compendium/spells/sleep.md)\n \n## Actions\n \n***Claws (Hag Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) slashing damage.\n \n***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn&#039;t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.\n \n***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.\n \n***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A [protection from evil and good](compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md) spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (`1d10`). If this effect reduces the target&#039;s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag&#039;s soul bag. The reduction to the target&#039;s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the  [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.\n \n## Lair actions\n \nThe following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag&#039;s most powerful ability.\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can&#039;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n \n- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren&#039;t there.  \n- The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.  \n \nA powerful night hag might have the following additional lair actions:\n \n- One creature the hag can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the hag&#039;s. If the creature wins, it escapes the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.  \n- The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see within 60 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be flung up to 30 feet through the air. A creature that strikes a solid object or is released in midair takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved or fallen.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nEach hag&#039;s lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag&#039;s most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to `2d10` days to fade away.\n \nThe region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag&#039;s lair is warped by the creature&#039;s fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n \n- Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n- Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.  \n \nA powerful night hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:\n \n- Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.  \n- Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, and cackling. The creatures are trapped there for a minute or two, and then returned to the place where they vanished from.  \n- Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves littering the hag&#039;s realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.  \n \n## Is copy\n \ntrue\n \n## _copied from\n \nHag (VGM)\n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/nightmare":{"title":"nightmare","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/size/large","monster/type/fiend"],"content":"Nightmare\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Nightmare\n![](compendium/bestiary/fiend/token/nightmare.png#token)\n*Large fiend, Neutral Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 13  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 68 (`8d10 + 24`)\n- **Speed** 60 ft., fly 90 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|18 (+4)|15 (+2)|16 (+3)|10 (+0)|13 (+1)|15 (+2)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** ⏤\n- **Skills** ⏤\n- **Senses** passive Perception 11\n- **Damage Immunities** fire\n- **Languages** understands Abyssal, Common, and Infernal but can&#039;t speak \n- **Challenge** 3\n \n## Traits\n \n***Confer Fire Resistance.*** The nightmare can grant resistance to fire damage to anyone riding it.\n \n***Illumination.*** The nightmare sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d6`) fire damage.\n \n***Ethereal Stride.*** The nightmare and up to three willing creatures within 5 feet of it magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend":{"title":"pit-fiend","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/size/large","monster/type/fiend/devil"],"content":"Pit Fiend\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Pit Fiend\n![](compendium/bestiary/fiend/token/pit-fiend.png#token)\n*Large fiend (devil), Lawful Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 19  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 300 (`24d10 + 168`)\n- **Speed** 30 ft., fly 60 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|26 (+8)|14 (+2)|24 (+7)|22 (+6)|18 (+4)|24 (+7)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +6\n- **Saving Throws** Dexterity +8, Constitution +13, Wisdom +10\n- **Skills** ⏤\n- **Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 14\n- **Damage Resistances** cold; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren&#039;t silvered\n- **Damage Immunities** fire, poison\n- **Condition Immunities** poisoned\n- **Languages** Infernal, telepathy 120 ft.\n- **Challenge** 20\n \n## Traits\n \n***Fear Aura.*** Any creature hostile to the pit fiend that starts its turn within 20 feet of the pit fiend must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, unless the pit fiend is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

A [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is [deafened](rules/conditions.md#deafened) and [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature is [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (`8d10`) thunder damage and is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).

The sphinx can choose not to reroll.  \n- The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become `1d20` years older or younger (the sphinx&#039;s choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell can restore a creature&#039;s age to normal.  \n- The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx&#039;s choice).

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Cantrip.*** The lich casts a cantrip.\n \n***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch.\n \n***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. The [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.  \n- The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich&#039;s lair.  \n- The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (`15d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.  \n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton":{"title":"minotaur-skeleton","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/underdark","monster/size/large","monster/type/undead"],"content":"Minotaur Skeleton\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Minotaur Skeleton\n![](compendium/bestiary/undead/token/minotaur-skeleton.png#token)\n*Large undead, Lawful Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 12  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 67 (`9d10 + 18`)\n- **Speed** 40 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|18 (+4)|11 (+0)|15 (+2)| 6 (-2)| 8 (-1)| 5 (-3)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** ⏤\n- **Skills** ⏤\n- **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9\n- **Damage Vulnerabilities** bludgeoning\n- **Damage Immunities** poison\n- **Condition Immunities** exhaustion, poisoned\n- **Languages** understands Abyssal but can&#039;t speak\n- **Challenge** 2\n \n## Traits\n \n***Charge.*** If the skeleton moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (`2d8`) piercing damage.

The cursed target can&#039;t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (`3d6`) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target&#039;s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or other magic.\n \n***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of the mummy&#039;s next turn.

Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the mummy lord&#039;s next turn.\n \n***Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).*** The mummy lord magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet of the mummy lord, including ones behind barriers and around corners, can&#039;t regain hit points until the end of the mummy lord&#039;s next turn.\n \n***Whirlwind of Sand (Costs 2 Actions).*** The mummy lord magically transforms into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts to its normal form.

Equipment worn or carried by the mummy lord remain in its possession.\n \n## Lair actions\n \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mummy lord takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the mummy lord can&#039;t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n \n- Each undead creature in the lair can pinpoint the location of each living creature within 120 feet of it until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- Each undead in the lair has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any non-undead creature that tries to cast a spell of 4th level or lower in the mummy lord&#039;s lair is wracked with pain. The creature can choose another action, but if it tries to cast the spell, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `1d6` necrotic damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted.  \n \n## Regional effects\n \nA mummy lord&#039;s temple or tomb is warped in any of the following ways by the creature&#039;s dark presence:\n \n- Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought into the lair. Other non magical drinks are spoiled - wine turning to vinegar, for instance.  \n- [Divination](compendium/spells/divination.md) spells cast within the lair by creatures other than the mummy lord have a 25% chance chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a [divination](compendium/spells/divination.md) spell already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance increases by 25 percent.  \n- A creature that takes treasure from the lair is cursed until the treasure is returned. The cursed target has disadvantage on all saving throws. The curse lasts until removed by a [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or other magic.  \n \nIf the mummy lord is destroyed, these regional effects end immediately.\n\nEnvironment\ndesert"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/undead/mummy":{"title":"mummy","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","monster/environment/desert","monster/size/medium","monster/type/undead"],"content":"Mummy\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\ntitle: Mummy\n![](compendium/bestiary/undead/token/mummy.png#token)\n*Medium undead, Lawful Evil*\n \n- **Armor Class** 11  (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points** 58 (`9d8 + 18`)\n- **Speed** 20 ft.\n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|16 (+3)| 8 (-1)|15 (+2)| 6 (-2)|10 (+0)|12 (+1)|\n \n- **Proficiency Bonus** +2\n- **Saving Throws** Wisdom +2\n- **Skills** ⏤\n- **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10\n- **Damage Vulnerabilities** fire\n- **Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical attacks\n- **Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison\n- **Condition Immunities** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned\n- **Languages** the languages it knew in life\n- **Challenge** 3\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack.*** The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.\n \n***Rotting Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage.

Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n \nWhile in mist form, the vampire can&#039;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&#039;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&#039;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.\n \n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n \n***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious), provided that it isn&#039;t in sunlight or running water. If it can&#039;t transform, it is destroyed.\n \nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&#039;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.\n \n***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&#039;t in sunlight or running water.

While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n \n## Actions\n \n***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).*** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.\n \n***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

The target&#039;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a [vampire spawn](compendium/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn.md) under the vampire&#039;s control.\n \n***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the vampire. The [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&#039;t under the vampire&#039;s control, it takes the vampire&#039;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&#039;s bite attack.\n \nEach time the vampire or the vampire&#039;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\n \n***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls `2d4` swarms of [bats](compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-bats.md) or [rats](compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md), provided that the sun isn&#039;t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call `3d6` [wolves](compendium/bestiary/beast/wolf.md) instead. The called creatures arrive in `1d4` rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.\n \n## Legendary Actions\n \n***Move.*** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.\n \n***Unarmed Strike.*** The vampire makes one unarmed strike.\n \n***Bite (Costs 2 Actions).*** The vampire makes one bite attack.\n \n## Regional effects\n \nThe region surrounding a vampire&#039;s lair is warped by the creature&#039;s unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:\n \n- There&#039;s a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.  \n- Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.  \n- Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.  \n- A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire&#039;s lair.

The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\nFrenzy (Level 3)\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage.

If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\nIntimidating Presence (Level 10)\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.\nRetaliation (Level 14)\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/barbarian":{"title":"barbarian","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/shield","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/greataxe","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/handaxe","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/explorers-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/javelin","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Actions"],"tags":["class/barbarian","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Barbarian\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\n\n                  \n                  Feature progression \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelPBFeatures1st+2Rage, Unarmored Defense2nd+2Danger Sense, Reckless Attack3rd+2Primal Path4th+2Ability Score Improvement5th+3Extra Attack, Fast Movement6th+3Path Feature7th+3Feral Instinct8th+3Ability Score Improvement9th+4Brutal Critical (1 die)10th+4Path feature11th+4Relentless Rage12th+4Ability Score Improvement13th+5Brutal Critical (2 dice)14th+5Path feature15th+5Persistent Rage16th+5Ability Score Improvement17th+6Brutal Critical (3 dice)18th+6Indomitable Might19th+6Ability Score Improvement20th+6Primal Champion\n\nPB: Proficiency Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Class progression \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelRagesRage Damage1st2+22nd2+23rd3+24th3+25th3+26th4+27th4+28th4+29th4+310th4+311th4+312th5+313th5+314th5+315th5+316th5+417th6+418th6+419th6+420thUnlimited+4\n\n1st-9th: Spell slots per level\n\n\n\n\nHit Points\n\nHit Dice: 1d12 per Barbarian level\nHit Points at First Level: 12 + CON\nHit Points at Higher Levels: add 7 OR 1d12 + CON  (minimum of 1)\n\nStarting Barbarian\nYou are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.\n\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\nArmor: light, medium, shields\nWeapons: simple, martial\nTools: none\nSkills: Choose 2 from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, Survival\n\nYou begin play with the following equipment, in addition to any equipment provided by your background.\n\n(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon\n(a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon\nAn explorer’s pack, and four javelins\n\nAlternatively, you may start with 2d4 × 10 gp and choose your own equipment.\nMulticlassing Barbarian\nTo multiclass as a Barbarian, you must meet the following prerequisites:\n\nStrength 13\n\nYou gain the following proficiencies:\n\nArmor: shields\nWeapons: simple, martial\nTools: none\n\nBarbarian\nA tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd.\nA half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.\nFrothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\nThese barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.\nFor some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\nPrimal Instinct\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.\nBarbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\nA Life of Danger\nNot every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\nCreating a Barbarian\nWhen creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Seret, archwizard \n                  \n                \n\nI have witnessed the indomitable performance of barbarians on the field of battle, and it makes me wonder what force lies at the heart of their rage.\n\n\nThe anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian’s driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls.\nIt can be tempting to play a barbarian character that is a straightforward application of the classic archetype—a brute, and usually a dimwitted one at that, who rushes in where others fear to tread. But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian stand out from all others; see the following sections for some ideas.\nPersonal Totems\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nBarbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few possessions they do carry often include small items that have special significance. A personal totem is significant because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an important moment in the character’s life—perhaps a remembrance from the barbarian’s past or a harbinger of what lies ahead.\nA personal totem of this sort might be associated with a barbarian’s spirit animal, or might actually be the totem object for the animal, but such a connection is not essential. One who has a bear totem spirit, for instance, could still carry an eagle’s feather as a personal totem.\nConsider creating one or more personal totems for your character—objects that hold a special link to your character’s past or future. Think about how a totem might affect your character’s actions.\nPersonal Totems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Totem1A tuft of fur from a solitary wolf that you befriended during a hunt2Three eagle feathers given to you by a wise shaman, who told you they would play a role in determining your fate3A necklace made from the claws of a young cave bear that you slew singlehandedly as a child4A small leather pouch holding three stones that represent your ancestors5A few small bones from the first beast you killed, tied together with colored wool6An egg-sized stone in the shape of your spirit animal that appeared one day in your belt pouch^personal-totems\nTattoos\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nThe members of many barbarian clans decorate their bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a significant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer’s ancestors, or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. As with personal totems, a barbarian’s tattoos might or might not be related to an animal spirit.\nEach tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that individual’s identity.

Some follow gods and look for guidance from those deities in the cycles of nature and the animals they encounter. These barbarians believe that spirits inhabit the plants and animals of the world, and the barbarians look to them for omens and power.\nOther barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in their veins and the steel they hold in their hands. They have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts they emulate.\nBoth of these attitudes can give rise to superstitions. These beliefs are often passed down within a family or shared among the members of a clan or a hunting group.\nIf your barbarian character has any superstitions, were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they the result of personal experience?\nSuperstition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Superstition1If you disturb the bones of the dead, you inherit all the troubles that plagued them in life.2Never trust a wizard.

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:\n\nYou have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\nWhen you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.\nYou have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\nOnce you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.\nUnarmored Defense (Level 1)\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.\nDanger Sense (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.\nReckless Attack (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.\nPrimal Path (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from the list of available paths. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nExtra Attack (Level 5)\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nFast Movement (Level 5)\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.\nPath Feature (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.\nFeral Instinct (Level 7)\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nBrutal Critical (1 die) (Level 9)\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\nPath feature (Level 10)\nAt 10th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.\nRelentless Rage (Level 11)\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nBrutal Critical (2 dice) (Level 13)\nAt 13th level, you can roll two additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\nThis increases to three additional dice at 17th level.\nPath feature (Level 14)\nAt 14th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.\nPersistent Rage (Level 15)\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nBrutal Critical (3 dice) (Level 17)\nAt 17th level, you can roll three additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\nIndomitable Might (Level 18)\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 19)\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nPrimal Champion (Level 20)\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard-college-of-lore":{"title":"bard-college-of-lore","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions"],"tags":["class/bard/lore","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"College of Lore\nBard: Bard College\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nClass Features\nCollege of Lore (Level 3)\nBards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\nThe college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.\nBonus Proficiencies (Level 3)\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\nCutting Words (Level 3)\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.\nAdditional Magical Secrets (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.\nPeerless Skill (Level 14)\nStarting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard":{"title":"bard","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/hand-crossbow","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/longsword","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/rapier","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/shortsword","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/diplomats-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/entertainers-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/lute","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/leather-armor","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/dagger","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/dancing-lights","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/vicious-mockery","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/charm-person","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/detect-magic","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/healing-word","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/thunderwave","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/horn","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/drum","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/cure-wounds","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions"],"tags":["class/bard","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Bard\nSource:

traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.\nA stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.\nLaughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received.\nWhether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.\nMusic and Magic\nIn the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.\nThe greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.\nLearning from Experience\nTrue bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.\nOnly rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.\nCreating a Bard\nBards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.\nDid you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?\nQuick Build\nYou can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background. Third, choose the dancing lights and vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing word, and thunderwave.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Fletcher Danairia, master bard \n                  \n                \n\nMusic is the fruit of the divine tree that vibrates with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power? Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!\n\n\nBards bring levity during grave times; they impart wisdom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time—knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.\nIt is also the bard’s role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events—the stories of today’s heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.\nOf course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there’s much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others—and from one another—are the style and substance of their performances.\nTo grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards are typically flamboyant and outgoing when they perform. The most famous of them are essentially the D&amp;D world’s equivalent of pop stars. If you’re playing a bard, consider using one of your favorite musicians as a role model for your character.\nYou can add some unique aspects to your bard character by considering the suggestions that follow.\nDefining Work\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nEvery successful bard is renowned for at least one piece of performance art, typically a song or a poem that is popular with everyone who hears it. These performances are spoken about for years by those who view them, and some spectators have had their lives forever changed because of the experience.\nIf your character is just starting out, your ultimate defining work is likely in the future. But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.\nDefining Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Defining Work1”The Three Flambinis,” a ribald song concerning mistaken identities and unfettered desire2”Waltz of the Myconids,” an upbeat tune that children in particular enjoy3”Asmodeus’s Golden Arse,” a dramatic poem you claim was inspired by your personal visit to Avernus4”The Pirates of Luskan,” your firsthand account of being kidnapped by sea reavers as a child5”A Hoop, Two Pigeons, and a Hell Hound,” a subtle parody of an incompetent noble6”A Fool in the Abyss,” a comedic poem about a jester’s travels among demons^defining-work\nInstrument\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nIn a bard’s quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one’s instrument is at least as important as one’s vocal ability. The instrument’s quality of manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument’s own entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.\nYou might have an “off the rack” instrument, perhaps because it’s all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?\nInstrument\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Instrument1A masterfully crafted halfling fiddle2A mithral horn made by elves3A zither made with drow spider silk4An orcish drum5A wooden bullywug croak box6A tinker’s harp of gnomish design^instrument\nEmbarrassment\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nAlmost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you’re no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.\nThe ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from it—either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that’s guaranteed to please.\nEmbarrassment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Embarrassment1The time when your comedic song, “Big Tom’s Hijinks”—which, by the way, you thought was brilliant—did not go over well with Big Tom2The matinee performance when a circus’s owlbear got loose and terrorized the crowd3When your opening song was your enthusiastic but universally hated rendition of “Song of the Froghemoth”4The first and last public performance of “Mirt, Man about Town”5The time on stage when your wig caught fire and you threw it down—which set fire to the stage6When you sat on your lute by mistake during the final stanza of “Starlight Serenade”^embarrassment\nA Bard’s Muse\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nNaturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse—a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience.\nA bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance.\nIf your bard character has a muse, it could be one of the three described here, or one of your own devising.\nNature\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nYou feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.\nLove\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nYou are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or bring joy to one’s every moment is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on many forms, and you can see its presence everywhere—from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song of a simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion.\nConflict\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nDrama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover’s spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.\nClass Features\nBardic Inspiration (Level 1)\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nSpellcasting (Level 1)\nYou have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the bard spell list.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.\nSpell Slots\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\nYou learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nJack of All Trades (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest (d6) (Level 2)\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\nExpertise (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nBardic Inspiration (d8) (Level 5)\nAt 5th level, your Bardic Inspiration die changes to a d8.\nFont of Inspiration (Level 5)\nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\nBard College feature (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain a feature from your Bard College.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nSong of Rest (d8) (Level 9)\nAt 9th level, the extra hit points gained from Song of Rest increases to 1d8.\nBardic Inspiration (d10) (Level 10)\nAt 10th level, your Bardic Inspiration die changes to a d10.\nExpertise (Level 10)\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nMagical Secrets (Level 10)\nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines.

Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).\nAt each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.\nLife Domain Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric LevelSpells1stbless, cure wounds3rdlesser restoration, spiritual weapon5thbeacon of hope, revivify7thdeath ward, guardian of faith9thmass cure wounds, raise dead^life-domain-spells\nBonus Proficiency (Level 1)\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.\nDisciple of Life (Level 1)\nAlso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.\nChannel Divinity: Preserve Life (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.\nBlessed Healer (Level 6)\nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.\nDivine Strike (Level 8)\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\nSupreme Healing (Level 17)\nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.\nHealers and Warriors\nDivine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.\nHarnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.\nClerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.\nDivine Agents\nNot every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.\nWhen a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.\nMost adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.\nCreating a Cleric\nAs you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. Appendix B includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.\nOnce you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?\nQuick Build\nYou can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Riggby the patriarch \n                  \n                \n\nTo become a cleric is to become a messenger of the gods. The power the divine offers is great, but it always comes with tremendous responsibility.\n\n\nAlmost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric—someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity’s power.\nThe question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to one’s deity, thereby attracting the god’s favor? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn’t matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.\nIf you’re playing a cleric character, the following sections offer ways to add some detail to that character’s history and personality.\nTemple\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nMost clerics start their lives of service as priests in an order, then later realize that they have been blessed by their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. To prepare for this new duty, candidates typically receive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another place of study devoted to their deity.\nSome temples are cut off from the world so that their occupants can focus on devotions, while other temples open their doors to minister to and heal the masses. What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?\nTemple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Temple1Your temple is said to be the oldest surviving structure built to honor your god.2Acolytes of several like-minded deities all received instruction together in your temple.3You come from a temple famed for the brewery it operates.

Even though such an item is not imbued with divine power, it is vitally important to its owner because of what it represents.\nKeepsake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Keepsake1The finger bone of a saint2A metal-bound book that tells how to hunt and destroy infernal creatures3A pig’s whistle that reminds you of your humble and beloved mentor4A braid of hair woven from the tail of a unicorn5A scroll that describes how best to rid the world of necromancers6A runestone said to be blessed by your god^keepsake\nSecret\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nNo mortal soul is entirely free of second thoughts or doubt.

The cleric’s magic flows from the god or the god’s sacred realm, and often the cleric bears a holy symbol that represents that divinity.\nSome clerics, especially in a world like Eberron, serve a whole pantheon, rather than a single deity. In certain campaigns, a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such as life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, peace, or one of the nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide explores options like these, in the section “Gods of Your World.”\nTalk with your DM about the divine options available in your campaign, whether they’re gods, pantheons, philosophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your cleric ends up serving, choose a Divine Domain that is appropriate for it, and if it doesn’t have a holy symbol, work with your DM to design one.\nThe cleric’s class features often refer to your deity. If you are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of the references to a god as references to the divine thing you serve that gives you your magic.\n\n\n\nClass Features\nSpellcasting (Level 1)\nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for a selection of cleric spells.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\nDivine Domain (Level 1)\nChoose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\nDomain Spells\nEach domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\nChannel Divinity (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead (Level 2)\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nDivine Domain feature (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDestroy Undead (CR 1/2) (Level 5)\nStarting at 5th level, when an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.\nChannel Divinity (Level 6)\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests.\nDivine Domain feature (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDestroy Undead (CR 1) (Level 8)\nStarting at 8th level, when an undead of CR 1 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.\nDivine Domain feature (Level 8)\nAt 8th level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.\nDivine Intervention (Level 10)\nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.\nImploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes.

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.\nBonus Cantrip (Level 2)\nYou learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of druid cantrips you know.\nNatural Recovery (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\nCircle Spells (Level 2)\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nArctic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdhold person, spike growth5thsleet storm, slow7thfreedom of movement, ice storm9thcommune with nature, cone of cold^arctic\nCoast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdmirror image, misty step5thwater breathing, water walk7thcontrol water, freedom of movement9thconjure elemental, scrying^coast\nDesert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdblur, silence5thcreate food and water, protection from energy7thblight, hallucinatory terrain9thinsect plague, wall of stone^desert\nForest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdbarkskin, spider climb5thcall lightning, plant growth7thdivination, freedom of movement9thcommune with nature, tree stride^forest\nGrassland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdinvisibility, pass without trace5thdaylight, haste7thdivination, freedom of movement9thdream, insect plague^grassland\nMountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdspider climb, spike growth5thlightning bolt, meld into stone7thstone shape, stoneskin9thpasswall, wall of stone^mountain\nSwamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rddarkness, Melf’s acid arrow5thwater walk, stinking cloud7thfreedom of movement, locate creature9thinsect plague, scrying^swamp\nUnderdark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid LevelCircle Spells3rdspider climb, web5thgaseous form, stinking cloud7thgreater invisibility, stone shape9thcloudkill, insect plague^underdark\nLand’s Stride (Level 6)\nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against

must meet the following prerequisites:\n\nWisdom 13\n\nYou gain the following proficiencies:\n\nArmor: light, medium\nWeapons: none\nTools: none\n\nDruid\nHolding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.\nCrouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.\nSwinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.\nWhether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.\nPower of Nature\nDruids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.\nDruid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.\nPreserve the Balance\nFor druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.\nDruids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.\nDruids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.\nCreating a Druid\nWhen making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.\nHave you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.\n\n\n                  \n                  Sacred Plants and Wood \n                  \n                \n\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Druids and the Gods \n                  \n                \n\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.\nIn the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.\nThe druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Safhran, archdruid \n                  \n                \n\nEven in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.\n\n\nDruids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.\nYour druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.\nTreasured Item\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nSome druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid’s mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.\nWhen you decide what your character’s treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?\nTreasured Item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Treasured Item1A twig from the meeting tree that stands in the center of your village2A vial of water from the source of a sacred river3Special herbs tied together in a bundle4A small bronze bowl engraved with animal images5A rattle made from a dried gourd and holly berries6A miniature golden sickle handed down to you by your mentor^treasured-item\nGuiding Aspects\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nMany druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.\nGuiding Aspects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Guiding Aspects1Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth.2Oak trees represent strength and vitality.

Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student’s attitudes and beliefs.\nIf your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?\nMentors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Mentors1Your mentor was a wise treant who taught you to think in terms of years and decades rather than days or months.2You were tutored by a dryad who watched over a slumbering portal to the Abyss.

That rule gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility, making it easy to amass an array of beast form options for yourself, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast Shapes table in that book.\nWhen you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you might wonder which beasts you’ve already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the monster manual according to the beasts’ most likely environments. Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that your druid has probably seen by 2nd level.\nThese tables can also help you and your DM determine which animals you might see on your travels. In addition, the tables include each beast’s challenge rating and note whether a beast has a flying or swimming speed. This information will help you determine whether you qualify to assume that beast’s form.\nThe tables include all the individual beasts that are eligible for Wild Shape (up to a challenge rating of 1) or the Circle Forms feature of the Circle of the Moon (up to a challenge rating of 6).\nArctic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRBeastFly/Swim0OwlFly1/8Blood hawkFly1/4Giant owlFly1Brown bear—2Polar

(Level 1)\nYou know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.\nSpellcasting (Level 1)\nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the druid spell list.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.\nBeast Shapes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelMax. CRLimitationsExample2nd1/4No flying or swimming speedWolf4th1/2No flying speedCrocodile8th1—Giant eagle^beast-shapes\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.\nWhen you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\nYou can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\n\nDruid Circle (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nWild Shape Improvement (Level 4)\nAt 4th level, your Wild Shape improves as shown on the Beast Shapes table.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDruid Circle feature (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle.\nWild Shape Improvement (Level 8)\nAt 8th level, your Wild Shape improves as shown on the Beast Shapes table.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDruid Circle feature (Level 10)\nAt 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDruid Circle feature (Level 14)\nAt 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nTimeless Body (Level 18)\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.\nBeast Spells (Level 18)\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape.

An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.\nA dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.\nA gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.\nAll of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.\nWell-Rounded Specialists\nFighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.\nTrained for Danger\nNot every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.\nSome fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.\nCreating a Fighter\nAs you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.\nYou might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Tordek \n                  \n                \n\nLet me know when you’re all done talking.\n\n\nOf all the adventurers in the worlds of D&amp;D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter’s motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.\nAlthough some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there’s gold in the offing, the true reward for most fighters comes from sending enemies to their doom.\nThe sections below offer ways to add a little depth and a few personal touches to your fighter character.\nHeraldic Sign\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nFighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one’s self-interest.\nYour character could be affiliated with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that’s not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.\nHeraldic Signs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Heraldic Signs1A rampant golden dragon on a green field, representing valor and a quest for wealth2The fist of a storm giant clutching lightning before a storm cloud, symbolizing wrath and power3Crossed greatswords in front of a castle gate, signifying the defense of a city or kingdom4A skull with a dagger through it, representing the doom you bring to your enemies5A phoenix in a ring of fire, an expression of an indomitable spirit6Three drops of blood beneath a horizontal sword blade on a black background, symbolizing three foes you have sworn to kill^heraldic-signs\nInstructor\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nSome fighters are natural-born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group.\nA third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student’s background.\nIf you decide that your character had an individual instructor, what is that person’s specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor’s teachings and adapt them to your own purposes?\nInstructor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Instructor1Gladiator.

Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter’s personality, that’s not always the case—someone’s approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.\nDo you have a combat style that mirrors your outlook on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when weapons are drawn?\nStyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Style1Elegant.

She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.\nWhatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.\nThe Magic of Ki\nMonks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.\nTraining and Asceticism\nSmall walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.\nSome monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.\nThe majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.\nFor a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.\nCreating a Monk\nAs you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?\nConsider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?\nAs a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Ember, grand master of flowers \n                  \n                \n\nDo not mistake my silence for acceptance of your villainy. While you blustered and threatened, I’ve planned four different ways to snap your neck with my bare hands.\n\n\nMonks walk a path of contradiction. They study their art as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are deadly combatants, their abilities on a par with those of a raging barbarian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace this seeming contradiction, for it speaks to the core of all monastic study. By coming to know oneself completely, one learns much of the wider world.\nA monk’s focus on inner mastery leads many such individuals to become detached from society, more concerned with their personal experience than with happenings elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed of an already rare type of character, taking their quest for perfection beyond the walls of the monastery into the world at large.\nPlaying a monk character offers many intriguing opportunities to try something different. To distinguish your monk character even further, consider the options in the sections that follow.\nMonastery\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nA monk studies in a monastery in preparation for a life of asceticism. Most of those who enter a monastery make it their home for the rest of their lives, with the exception of adventurers and others who have reason to leave. For those individuals, a monastery might serve as a refuge between excursions to the world or as a source of support in times of need.\nWhat sort of place was your monastery, and where is it located? Did attending it contribute to your experience in an unusual or distinctive way?\nMonastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Monastery1Your monastery is carved out of a mountainside, where it looms over a treacherous pass.2Your monastery is high in the branches of an immense tree in the Feywild.3Your monastery was founded long ago by a cloud giant and is inside a cloud castle that can be reached only by flying.4Your monastery is built beside a volcanic system of hot springs, geysers, and sulfur pools. You regularly received visits from azer traders.5Your monastery was founded by gnomes and is an underground labyrinth of tunnels and rooms.6Your monastery was carved from an iceberg in the frozen reaches of the world.^monastery\nIcon\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nEven in the monastic lifestyle, which eschews materialism and personal possessions, symbolism plays an important part in defining the identity of an order. Some monastic orders treat certain creatures with special regard, either because the creature is tied to the order’s history or because it serves as an example of a quality the monks seek to emulate.\nIf your character’s monastery had a special icon, you might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere inconspicuous on your clothing to serve as an identifying mark. Or perhaps your order’s icon does not have a physical form but is expressed through a gesture or a posture that you adopt, and which other monks might know how to interpret.\nIcon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Icon1Monkey.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\nWhen you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.\n\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).\nKi (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nFlurry of Blows (Level 2)\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\nPatient Defense (Level 2)\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\nStep of the Wind (Level 2)\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\nUnarmored Movement (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nDeflect Missiles (Level 3)\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.\nMonastic Tradition (Level 3)\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nSlow Fall (Level 4)\nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\nExtra Attack (Level 5)\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nStunning Strike (Level 5)\nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\nKi-Empowered Strikes (Level 6)\nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nMonastic Tradition feature (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain one feature granted by your Monastic Tradition.\nEvasion (Level 7)\nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStillness of Mind (Level 7)\nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nUnarmored Movement improvement (Level 9)\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nPurity of Body (Level 10)\nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.\nMonastic Tradition feature (Level 11)\nAt 11th level, you gain one feature granted by your Monastic Tradition.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nTongue of the Sun and Moon (Level 13)\nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.\nDiamond Soul (Level 14)\nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\nTimeless Body (Level 15)\nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nMonastic Tradition feature (Level 17)\nAt 17th level, you gain one feature granted by your Monastic Tradition.\nEmpty Body (Level 18)\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 19)\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nPerfect Self (Level 20)\nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/paladin-oath-of-devotion":{"title":"paladin-oath-of-devotion","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/paladin","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/sanctuary","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/lesser-restoration","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/zone-of-truth","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/beacon-of-hope","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/dispel-magic","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/freedom-of-movement","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/guardian-of-faith","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/commune","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/flame-strike","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Actions"],"tags":["class/paladin/devotion","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Oath of Devotion\nPaladin: Sacred Oath\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nClass Features\nOath of Devotion (Level 3)\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion (Level 3)\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\nHonesty\nDon’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\nCourage\nNever fear to act, though caution is wise.\nCompassion\nAid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\nHonor\nTreat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.\nDuty\nBe responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells (Level 3)\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nOath of Devotion Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaladin LevelSpells3rdprotection from evil and good, sanctuary5thlesser restoration, zone of truth9thbeacon of hope, dispel magic13thfreedom of movement, guardian of faith17thcommune, flame strike^oath-of-devotion-spells\nChannel Divinity (Level 3)\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\nSacred Weapon (Level 3)\nAs an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\nTurn the Unholy (Level 3)\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.

His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.\nWhatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.\nThe Cause of Righteousness\nA paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.\nPaladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.\nBeyond the Mundane Life\nAlmost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.\nAdventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.\nCreating a Paladin\nThe most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.\nHow did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.\nAs guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Isteval \n                  \n                \n\nThe true worth of a paladin is measured not in foes defeated or dungeons plundered. It is measured in lives saved and hearts turned to the causes of mercy and justice.\n\n\nA paladin is a living embodiment of an oath—a promise or a vow made manifest in the person of a holy warrior who has the skill and the determination to see the cause through to the end. Some paladins devote themselves expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading justice in the world, while others resolve to attain that goal by conquering those who stand defiant and bringing them under the rule of law.\nAlthough no paladin in the world could be described as typical, a number of them are narrow-minded do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest deviation from their own outlook. Paladins who take up the adventuring life, however, rarely remain so rigid in their attitudes—if only to keep from alienating their companions.\nYou can flesh out your paladin character by using the suggestions below. It’s important to keep in mind that most paladins aren’t robots. They have doubts and prejudices and harbor contradictory thoughts just as any other character does. Some are compelled by an internal motivation that might sometimes be at odds with the principles of their oaths.\nPersonal Goal\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nThe precepts of a paladin’s oath provide purpose to the character and dictate an ultimate goal or an overall intent that the paladin abides by and advances. Aside from that, some paladins are driven by a personal goal that either complements or transcends the dictates of their oaths. Paladins who swear different oaths might have the same personal goal, differing only in how they apply that goal to their actions when upholding their oaths.\nIf your paladin character has a personal goal, it might be drawn from some life event and thus not directly tied to the oath.\nPersonal Goal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Personal Goal1Peace.

Your symbol exemplifies the oath you have taken and communicates that message to those around you, friend and foe alike.\nYour symbol might be displayed on a banner, a flag, or your clothing for all to see. Or it could be less obvious, such as a trinket or a token that you carry concealed on your person.\nSymbol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Symbol1A dragon, emblematic of your nobility in peace and your ferocity in combat2A clenched fist, because you are always ready to fight for your beliefs3An upraised open hand, indicating your preference for diplomacy over combat4A red heart, showing the world your commitment to justice5A black heart, signifying that emotions such as pity do not sway your dedication to your oath6An unblinking eye, meaning that you are ever alert to all threats against your cause^symbol\nNemesis\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nTheir adherence to a sacred oath demands that paladins take an active stance in carrying their beliefs into the world. This activity naturally leads to conflict with creatures or entities that oppose those beliefs. Among those opponents, one often stands out as a paladin’s most persistent or most formidable foe—a nemesis whose presence or influence is a constant factor in a paladin’s life.\nYour paladin character might have an enemy that dates from the days before you took up your path. Or you could be a target because when you became a paladin, you immediately attracted the attention of those that would do you in. If you have a nemesis, who or what is it? Whom among your enemies do you consider to be the biggest threat to achieving your goals?\nNemesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Nemesis1A mighty orc war chief who threatens to overrun and destroy everything you hold sacred2A fiend or a celestial, the agent of a power of the Outer Planes, who has been charged with corrupting or redeeming you, as appropriate3A dragon whose servants dog your steps4A high priest who sees you as a misguided fool and wants you to abandon your religion5A rival paladin who trained with you but became an oath-breaker and holds you responsible6A vampire who has sworn revenge against all paladins after being defeated by one^nemesis\nTemptation\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nAlthough paladins are dedicated to their oaths, they are mortals, and thus they are flawed.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\nLay on Hands (Level 1)\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\nDivine Smite (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.\nFighting Style (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.\n\nDefense\nDueling\nGreat Weapon Fighting\nProtection\n\nSpellcasting (Level 2)\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the paladin spell list.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\nDivine Health (Level 3)\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\nSacred Oath (Level 3)\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\nOath Spells\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\nChannel Divinity (Level 3)\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n\n                  \n                  Breaking Your Oath \n                  \n                \n\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.\n\n\n\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nExtra Attack (Level 5)\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nAura of Protection (Level 6)\nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nSacred Oath feature (Level 7)\nAt 7th level, you gain a feature granted to you by your Sacred Oath.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nAura of Courage (Level 10)\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nImproved Divine Smite (Level 11)\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nCleansing Touch (Level 14)\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nSacred Oath feature (Level 15)\nAt 15th level, you gain a feature granted to you by your Sacred Oath.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nAura improvements (Level 18)\nAt 18th level, the range of your Aura of Protection increases to 30 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 19)\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nSacred Oath feature (Level 20)\nAt 20th level, you gain a feature granted to you by your Sacred Oath.\nOptional Features\n\n\n                  \n                  Fighting Style, Paladin \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/ranger-hunter":{"title":"ranger-hunter","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/ranger","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/lightning-bolt"],"tags":["class/ranger/hunter","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Hunter\nRanger: Ranger Archetype\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nClass Features\nHunter (Level 3)\nEmulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness.

Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.\nAfter tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.\nHolding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.\nFar from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.\nDeadly Hunters\nWarriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.\nThanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.\nIndependent Adventurers\nThough a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.\nThis fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.\nCreating a Ranger\nAs you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.\nWhat’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?\nQuick Build\nYou can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Soveliss \n                  \n                \n\nI spend a lot of my life away from civilization, keeping to its fringes to protect it. Don’t assume that because I don’t bend the knee to your king that I haven’t done more to protect him than all his knights put together.\n\n\nRangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who patrol the edges of civilized territory, turning back the denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their work makes the world a safer place.\nA relationship with civilization informs every ranger’s personality and history. Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization’s frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms and other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it.\nIf you’re creating or playing a ranger character, the following sections offer ideas for embellishing the character and enhancing your roleplaying experience.\nView of the World\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nA ranger’s view of the world begins (and sometimes ends) with that character’s outlook toward civilized folk and the places they occupy. Some rangers have an attitude toward civilization that’s deeply rooted in disdain, while others pity the people they have sworn to protect—though on the battlefield, it’s impossible to tell the difference between one ranger and another. Indeed, to those who have seen them operate and been the beneficiaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express their opinions on any matter in the same way.\nIf you haven’t yet thought about the details of your character’s worldview, consider putting a finer point on things by summarizing that viewpoint in a short statement (such as the entries on the following table). How might that feeling affect the way you conduct yourself?\nView of the World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6View1Towns and cities are the best places for those who can’t survive on their own.2The advancement of civilization is the best way to thwart chaos, but its reach must be monitored.3Towns and cities are a necessary evil, but once the wilderness is purged of supernatural threats, we will need them no more.4Walls are for cowards, who huddle behind them while others do the work of making the world safe.5Visiting a town is not unpleasant, but after a few days I feel the irresistible call to return to the wild.6Cities breed weakness by isolating folk from the harsh lessons of the wild.^view-of-the-world\nHomelands\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nAll rangers, regardless of how they came to take up the profession, have a strong connection to the natural world and its various terrains. For some rangers, the wilderness is where they grew up, either as a result of being born there or moving there at a young age. For other rangers, civilization was originally home, but the wilderness became a second homeland.\nThink of your character’s backstory and decide what terrain feels most like home, whether or not you were born there. What does that terrain say about your personality? Does it influence which spells you choose to learn? Have your experiences there shaped who your favored enemies are?\nHomelands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Homeland1You patrolled an ancient forest, darkened and corrupted by several crossings to the Shadowfell.2As part of a group of nomads, you acquired the skills for surviving in the desert.3Your early life in the Underdark prepared you for the challenges of combating its denizens.4You dwelled on the edge of a swamp, in an area imperiled by land creatures as well as aquatic ones.5Because you grew up among the peaks, finding the best path through the mountains is second nature to you.6You wandered the far north, learning how to protect yourself and prosper in a realm overrun by ice.^homelands\nSworn Enemy\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nEvery ranger begins with a favored enemy (or two). The determination of a favored enemy might be tied to a specific event in the character’s early life, or it might be entirely a matter of choice.\nWhat spurred your character to select a particular enemy? Was the choice made because of tradition or curiosity, or do you have a grudge to settle?\nSworn Enemies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Enemy1You seek revenge on nature’s behalf for the great transgressions your foe has committed.2Your forebears or predecessors fought these creatures, and so shall you.3You bear no enmity toward your foe. You stalk such creatures as a hunter tracks down a wild animal.4You find your foe fascinating, and you collect books of tales and history concerning it.5You collect tokens of your fallen enemies to remind you of each kill.6You respect your chosen enemy, and you see your battles as a test of respective skills.^sworn-enemies\nClass Features\nFavored Enemy (Level 1)\nBeginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.\nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.\nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.\nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.\nNatural Explorer (Level 1)\nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\n\nDifficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.\nYour group can’t become lost except by magical means.\nEven when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\nIf you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\nWhen you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\nWhile tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.\n\nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.\nFighting Style (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\nArchery\nDefense\nDueling\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\n\nSpellcasting (Level 2)\nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the ranger spell list.\nSpell Slots\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRanger Archetype (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\nPrimeval Awareness (Level 3)\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nExtra Attack (Level 5)\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nFavored Enemy and Natural Explorer improvements (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain an additional favored terrain.\nAt 6th level, you choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nLand’s Stride (Level 8)\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the entangle spell.\nHide in Plain Sight (Level 10)\nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.\nNatural Explorer improvement (Level 10)\nYou gain an additional favored terrain.\nRanger Archetype feature (Level 11)\nAt 11th level, you gain a feature granted to you by your Ranger Archetype.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nVanish (Level 14)\nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.\nFavored Enemy improvement (Level 14)\nAt 14th level, you choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language. Your choice should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.\nRanger Archetype feature (Level 15)\nAt 15th level, you gain a feature granted to you by your Ranger Archetype.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nFeral Senses (Level 18)\nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 19)\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nFoe Slayer (Level 20)\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\nOptional Features\n\n\n                  \n                  Fighting Style, Ranger \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/rogue-thief":{"title":"rogue-thief","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/rogue","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/skills","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/thieves-tools","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Actions"],"tags":["class/rogue/thief","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Thief\nRogue: Roguish Archetype\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nClass Features\nThief (Level 3)\nYou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.\nFast Hands (Level 3)\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\nSecond-Story Work (Level 3)\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.\nSupreme Sneak (Level 9)\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.\nUse Magic Device (Level 13)\nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you.

She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.\nA human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.\nSuppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.\nRogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.\nSkill and Precision\nRogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.\nWhen it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.\nA Shady Living\nEvery town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.\nAs adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.\nCreating a Rogue\nAs you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?\nWhat was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Barnabas Bladecutter \n                  \n                \n\nPeople forget that the entire point of venturing down into a dusty tomb is to bring back the prizes hidden away there. Fighting is for fools. Dead men can’t spend their fortunes.\n\n\nWhen brute force won’t get the job done, or when magic isn’t available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.\nSome rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.\nOn adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach—few rogues enjoy combat—with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue’s mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.\nThe following sections explore certain facets of what it means to be a rogue, which you can use to add depth to your character.\nGuilty Pleasures\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nMost of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking—an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky.\nA rogue’s guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can’t go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.\nWhat’s the one form of temptation that your rogue character can’t resist when the opportunity presents itself, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and your companions?\nGuilty Pleasures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Pleasure1Large gems2A smile from a pretty face3A new ring for your finger4The chance to deflate someone’s ego5The finest food and drink6Adding to your collection of exotic coins^guilty-pleasures\nAdversaries\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nNaturally, those who enforce the law are bound to come up against those who break it, and it’s the rare rogue who isn’t featured on at least one wanted poster. Beyond that, it’s in the nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they’re likely to be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch.\nIf your character’s backstory doesn’t already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to come up with a reason why an adversary has appeared in your life. Perhaps you’ve been the subject of scrutiny for a while from someone who wants to use you for nefarious purposes and has just now become known to you. Such an incident could be the basis for an upcoming adventure.\nDoes your rogue character have an adversary who also happens to be a criminal? If so, how is this relationship affecting your life?\nAdversaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Adversary1The pirate captain on whose ship you once served; what you call moving on, the captain calls mutiny2A master spy to whom you unwittingly fed bad information, which led to the assassination of the wrong target3The master of the local thieves’ guild, who wants you to join the organization or leave town4An art collector who uses illegal means to acquire masterpieces5A fence who uses you as a messenger to set up illicit meetings6The proprietor of an illegal pit fighting arena where you once took bets^adversaries\nBenefactor\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nFew rogues make it far in life before needing someone’s help, which means thereafter owing that benefactor a significant debt.\nIf your character’s backstory doesn’t already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor did for you without realizing who was responsible, and that person has now just become known to you. Who helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the time, and what do you owe that person as recompense?\nBenefactors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Benefactor1A smuggler kept you from getting caught but lost a valuable shipment in doing so.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.\nSneak Attack (Level 1)\nBeginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.\nYou don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.\nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.\nThieves’ Cant (Level 1)\nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.\nCunning Action (Level 2)\nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\nRoguish Archetype (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nUncanny Dodge (Level 5)\nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.\nExpertise (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain the benefit of Expertise.\nEvasion (Level 7)\nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nRoguish Archetype feature (Level 9)\nAt 9th level, you gain a feature granted by your Roguish Archetype.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 10)\nWhen you reach 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nReliable Talent (Level 11)\nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nRoguish Archetype feature (Level 13)\nAt 13th level, you gain a feature granted by your Roguish Archetype.\nBlindsense (Level 14)\nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.\nSlippery Mind (Level 15)\nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nRoguish Archetype feature (Level 17)\nAt 17th level, you gain a feature granted by your Roguish Archetype.\nElusive (Level 18)\nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 19)\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nStroke of Luck (Level 20)\nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/sorcerer-draconic-bloodline":{"title":"sorcerer-draconic-bloodline","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/sorcerer","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions"],"tags":["class/sorcerer/draconic","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Draconic Bloodline\nSorcerer: Sorcerous Origin\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nClass Features\nDraconic Bloodline (Level 1)\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\nDragon Ancestor (Level 1)\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor.

Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\nDraconic Resilience (Level 1)\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\nElemental Affinity (Level 6)\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\nDragon Wings (Level 14)\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\nDraconic Presence (Level 18)\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/sorcerer":{"title":"sorcerer","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/dagger","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/dart","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/sling","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/quarterstaff","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/light-crossbow","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/crossbow-bolts-20","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/component-pouch","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/dungeoneers-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/explorers-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/light","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/prestidigitation","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/ray-of-frost","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/shocking-grasp","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/shield","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/magic-missile","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/burning-hands","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/careful-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/distant-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/empowered-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/extended-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/heightened-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/quickened-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/subtle-spell","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/twinned-spell"],"tags":["class/sorcerer","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Sorcerer\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\n\n                  \n                  Feature progression \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelPBFeatures1st+2Spellcasting, Sorcerous Origin2nd+2Font of Magic3rd+2Metamagic4th+2Ability Score Improvement5th+3⏤6th+3Sorcerous Origin feature7th+3⏤8th+3Ability Score Improvement9th+4⏤10th+4Metamagic11th+4⏤12th+4Ability Score Improvement13th+5⏤14th+5Sorcerous Origin feature15th+5⏤16th+5Ability Score Improvement17th+6Metamagic18th+6Sorcerous Origin feature19th+6Ability Score Improvement20th+6Sorcerous Restoration\n\nPB: Proficiency Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Class progression \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelSorcery PointsCantrips KnownSpells Known1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7th8th9th1st⏤422⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤2nd2433⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤3rd34442⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤4th45543⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤5th556432⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤6th657433⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤7th7584331⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤8th8594332⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤9th951043331⏤⏤⏤⏤10th1061143332⏤⏤⏤⏤11th11612433321⏤⏤⏤12th12612433321⏤⏤⏤13th136134333211⏤⏤14th146134333211⏤⏤15th1561443332111⏤16th1661443332111⏤17th1761543332111118th1861543333111119th1961543333211120th20615433332211\n\n1st-9th: Spell slots per level\n\n\n\n\nHit Points\n\nHit Dice: 1d6 per Sorcerer level\nHit Points at First Level: 6 + CON\nHit Points at Higher Levels: add 4 OR 1d6 + CON  (minimum of 1)\n\nStarting Sorcerer\nYou are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.\n\nSaving Throws: Constitution, Charisma\nArmor: none\nWeapons: daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows\nTools: none\nSkills: Choose 2 from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, Religion\n\nYou begin play with the following equipment, in addition to any equipment provided by your background.\n\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon\n(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus\n(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack\nTwo daggers\n\nAlternatively, you may start with 3d4 × 10 gp and choose your own equipment.\nMulticlassing Sorcerer\nTo multiclass as a Sorcerer, you must meet the following prerequisites:\n\nCharisma 13\n\nSorcerer\nGolden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.\nLong hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.\nCrouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.\nSorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.\nRaw Magic\nMagic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.\nThe appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.\nSorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.\nUnexplained Powers\nSorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.\nSorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.\nCreating a Sorcerer\nThe most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?\nHow do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and magic missile.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Hennet, scion of Tiamat \n                  \n                \n\nPractice and study are for amateurs. True power is a birthright.\n\n\nWhen it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.\nBecause the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.\nSorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.\nPlaying a sorcerer character can be as rewarding as it is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on how to flesh out and personalize your persona.\nArcane Origins\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nSome sorcerers understand where their power came from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a way that suggests no particular cause.\nDoes your character know the source of your magical power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn’t know where their power arose from, your DM can use this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when the information plays a role in the campaign.\nArcane Origins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Origin1Your power arises from your family’s bloodline.

Were other people supportive, fearful, or somewhere in between?\nReactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Reaction1Your powers are seen as a great blessing by those around you, and you are expected to use them in service to your community.2Your powers caused destruction and even a death when they became evident, and you were treated as a criminal.3Your neighbors hate and fear your power, causing them to shun you.4You came to the attention of a sinister cult that plans on exploiting your abilities.5People around you believe that your powers are a curse levied on your family for a past transgression.6Your powers are believed to be tied to an ancient line of mad kings that supposedly ended in a bloody revolt over a century ago.^reactions\nSupernatural Mark\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nA sorcerer at rest is almost indistinguishable from a normal person; it’s only when their magic flies forth that sorcerers reveal their true nature. Even so, many sorcerers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them apart from other folk.\nIf your sorcerer has a supernatural mark, it might be one that’s easily concealed, or it could be a source of pride that you keep on constant display.\nSupernatural Marks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Mark1Your eyes are an unusual color, such as red.2You have an extra toe on one foot.3One of your ears is noticeably larger than the other.4Your hair grows at a prodigious rate.5You wrinkle your nose repeatedly while you are chewing.6A red splotch appears on your neck once a day, then vanishes after an hour.^supernatural-marks\nSigns of Sorcery\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nAs the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell. But even when one’s magic goes off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical energy came from.\nWhen your sorcerer character casts a spell, does the effort reveal itself in a sign of sorcery? Is this sign tied to your origin or some other aspect of who you are, or is it a seemingly random phenomenon?\nSigns of Sorcery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Sign1You deliver the verbal components of your spells in the booming voice of a titan.2For a moment after you cast a spell, the area around you grows dark and gloomy.3You sweat profusely while casting a spell and for a few seconds thereafter.4Your hair and garments are briefly buffeted about, as if by a breeze, whenever you call forth a spell.5If you are standing when you cast a spell, you rise six inches into the air and gently float back down.6Illusory blue flames wreathe your head as you begin your casting, then abruptly disappear.^signs-of-sorcery\nClass Features\nSpellcasting (Level 1)\nAn event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the sorcerer spell list.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.\nSpell Slots\nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.\nYou learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\nSorcerous Origin (Level 1)\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, from the list of available origins.\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\nFont of Magic (Level 2)\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nSorcery Points (Level 2)\nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.\nFlexible Casting (Level 2)\nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.\nCreating Spell Slots\nYou can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.\nCreating Spell Slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Slot LevelSorcery Point Cost1st22nd33rd54th65th7^creating-spell-slots\nConverting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level.\nMetamagic (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs.

Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.\nSworn and Beholden\nA warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.\nThe magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.\nDelvers into Secrets\nWarlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.\nStories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.\nOnce a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.\nCreating a Warlock\nAs you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?\nWork with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.\nWhat kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?\nHow does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the eldritch blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells charm person and witch bolt.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Xarren, herald of Acamar \n                  \n                \n\nYou think me mad? I think true insanity is being content to live a life of mortal drudgery when knowledge and power is there for the taking in the realm beyond.\n\n\nWarlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery.\nWarlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock’s entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god’s ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.\nThe sections that follow provide ways to embellish a warlock character that could generate some intriguing story and roleplaying opportunities.\nPatron’s Attitude\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nEvery relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it’s not necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with opposing emotions.\nWhen you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward your patron, also consider how things look from the patron’s perspective. How does your patron behave toward you? Is your patron a friend and ally, or an enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?\nPatron Attitudes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Attitude1Your patron has guided and helped your family for generations and is kindly toward you.2Each interaction with your capricious patron is a surprise, whether pleasant or painful.3Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead hero who sees your pact as a way for it to continue to influence the world.4Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you with a measure of respect.5Your patron tricked you into a pact and treats you as a slave.6You are mostly left to your own devices with no interference from your patron. Sometimes you dread the demands it will make when it does appear.^patron-attitudes\nSpecial Terms of the Pact\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nA pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of requirements. The terms of a pact—what a warlock must do to receive a patron’s favor—are always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks take these dictates as seriously as they do the other requirements of their pacts.\nDoes your character have a pact that requires you to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn’t imposed such a duty on you already, that’s not to say it couldn’t still happen.\nSpecial Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Term1When directed, you must take immediate action against a specific enemy of your patron.2Your pact tests your willpower; you are required to abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants.3At least once a day, you must inscribe or carve your patron’s name or symbol on the wall of a building.4You must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to maintain your pact.5You can never wear the same outfit twice, since your patron finds such predictability to be boring.6When you use an eldritch invocation, you must speak your patron’s name aloud or risk incurring its displeasure.^special-terms\nBinding Mark\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nSome patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the warlocks under their sway in some fashion. A binding mark makes it clear—to those who know about such things—that the individual in question is bound to the patron’s service. A warlock might take advantage of such a mark, claiming it as proof of one’s pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid the difficulties it might bring.\nIf your warlock’s pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source of pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?\nBinding Marks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Mark1One of your eyes looks the same as one of your patron’s eyes.2Each time you wake up, the small blemish on your face appears in a different place.3You display outward symptoms of a disease but suffer no ill effects from it.4Your tongue is an unnatural color.5You have a vestigial tail.6Your nose glows in the dark.^binding-marks\nClass Features\nPact Magic (Level 1)\nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the warlock spell list.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\nSpell Slots\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\nOtherworldly Patron (Level 1)\nAt 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being chosen from the list of available patrons.

A list of the available options can be found on the Optional Features page. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nPact Boon (Level 3)\nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.

Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\nEvocation Savant (Level 2)\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\nSculpt Spells (Level 2)\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\nPotent Cantrip (Level 6)\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\nEmpowered Evocation (Level 10)\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\nOverchannel (Level 14)\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th-level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard":{"title":"wizard","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/dagger","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/dart","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/sling","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/quarterstaff","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/light-crossbow","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/component-pouch","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/scholars-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/explorers-pack","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/spellbook","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/mage-hand","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/light","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/ray-of-frost","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/burning-hands","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/charm-person","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/feather-fall","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/mage-armor","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/magic-missile","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/sleep","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/skills"],"tags":["class/wizard","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\n\n                  \n                  Feature progression \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelPBFeatures1st+2Arcane Recovery, Spellcasting2nd+2Arcane Tradition3rd+2⏤4th+2Ability Score Improvement5th+3⏤6th+3Arcane Tradition feature7th+3⏤8th+3Ability Score Improvement9th+4⏤10th+4Arcane Tradition feature11th+4⏤12th+4Ability Score Improvement13th+5⏤14th+5Arcane Tradition feature15th+5⏤16th+5Ability Score Improvement17th+6⏤18th+6Spell Mastery19th+6Ability Score Improvement20th+6Signature Spells\n\nPB: Proficiency Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Class progression \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelCantrips Known1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7th8th9th1st32⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤2nd33⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤3rd342⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤4th443⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤5th4432⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤6th4433⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤7th44331⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤8th44332⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤9th443331⏤⏤⏤⏤10th543332⏤⏤⏤⏤11th5433321⏤⏤⏤12th5433321⏤⏤⏤13th54333211⏤⏤14th54333211⏤⏤15th543332111⏤16th543332111⏤17th543332111118th543333111119th543333211120th5433332211\n\n1st-9th: Spell slots per level\n\n\n\n\nHit Points\n\nHit Dice: 1d6 per Wizard level\nHit Points at First Level: 6 + CON\nHit Points at Higher Levels: add 4 OR 1d6 + CON  (minimum of 1)\n\nStarting Wizard\nYou are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.\n\nSaving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom\nArmor: none\nWeapons: daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows\nTools: none\nSkills: Choose 2 from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Religion\n\nYou begin play with the following equipment, in addition to any equipment provided by your background.\n\n(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger\n(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus\n(a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack\nA spellbook\n\nAlternatively, you may start with 4d4 × 10 gp and choose your own equipment.\nMulticlassing Wizard\nTo multiclass as a Wizard, you must meet the following prerequisites:\n\nIntelligence 13\n\nWizard\nClad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.\nChecking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.\nCrouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.\nWizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.\nScholars of the Arcane\nWild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.\nWizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.\nThe Lure of Knowledge\nWizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.\nBut the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.\nCreating a Wizard\nCreating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?\nWhat drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.\nQuick Build\nYou can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. If you plan to join the School of Enchantment, make Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and ray of frost cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning hands, charm person, feather fall, mage armor, magic missile, and sleep.\n\n\n                  \n                  A quote from Gimble the illusionist \n                  \n                \n\nWizardry requires understanding. The knowledge of how and why magic works, and our efforts to broaden that understanding, have brought about the key advances in civilization over the centuries.\n\n\nOnly a select few people in the world are wielders of magic. Of all those, wizards stand at the pinnacle of the craft. Even the least of them can manipulate forces that flout the laws of nature, and the most accomplished among them can cast spells with world-shaking effects.\nThe price that wizards pay for their mastery is that most valuable of commodities: time. It takes years of study, instruction, and experimentation to learn how to harness magical energy and carry spells around in one’s own mind. For adventuring wizards and other spellcasters who aspire to the highest echelons of the profession, the studying never ends, nor does the quest for knowledge and power.\nIf you’re playing a wizard, take advantage of the opportunity to make your character more than just a stereotypical spell-slinger. Use the advice that follows to add some intriguing details to how your wizard interacts with the world.\nSpellbook\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nYour wizard character’s most prized possession—your spellbook—might be an innocuous-looking volume whose covers show no hint of what’s inside. Or you might display some flair, as many wizards do, by carrying a spellbook of an unusual sort. If you don’t own such an item already, one of your goals might be to find a spellbook that sets you apart by its appearance or its means of manufacture.\nSpellbooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Spellbook1A tome with pages that are thin sheets of metal, spells etched into them with acid2Long straps of leather on which spells are written, wrapped around a staff for ease of transport3A battered tome filled with pictographs that only you can understand4Small stones inscribed with spells and kept in a cloth bag5A scorched book, ravaged by dragon fire, with the script of your spells barely visible on its pages6A tome full of black pages whose writing is visible only in dim light or darkness^spellbooks\nAmbition\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nFew aspiring wizards undertake the study of magic without some personal goal in mind. Many wizards use their spells as a tool to produce a tangible benefit, in material goods or in status, for themselves or their companions. For others, the theoretical aspect of magic might have a strong appeal, pushing those wizards to seek out knowledge that supports new theories of the arcane or confirms old ones.\nBeyond the obvious, why does your wizard character study magic, and what do you want to achieve? If you haven’t given these questions much thought, you can do so now, and the answers you come up with will likely affect how your future unfolds.\nAmbitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Ambition1You will prove that the gods aren’t as powerful as folk believe.2Immortality is the end goal of your studies.3If you can fully understand magic, you can unlock its use for all and usher in an era of equality.4Magic is a dangerous tool. You use it to protect what you treasure.5Arcane power must be taken away from those who would abuse it.6You will become the greatest wizard the world has seen in generations.^ambitions\nEccentricity\nSource: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\nEndless hours of solitary study and research can have a negative effect on anyone’s social skills. Wizards, who are a breed apart to begin with, are no exception. An odd mannerism or two is not necessarily a drawback, though; an eccentricity of this sort is usually harmless and could provide a source of amusement or serve as a calling card of sorts.\nIf your character has an eccentricity, is it a physical tic or a mental one? Are you well known in some circles because of it? Do you fight to overcome it, or do you embrace this minor claim to fame of yours?\nEccentricities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: d6Eccentricity1You have the habit of tapping your foot incessantly, which often annoys those around you.2Your memory is quite good, but you have no trouble pretending to be absentminded when it suits your purposes.3You never enter a room without looking to see what’s hanging from the ceiling.4Your most prized possession is a dead worm that you keep inside a potion vial.5When you want people to leave you alone, you start talking to yourself. That usually does the trick.6Your fashion sense and grooming, or more accurately lack thereof, sometimes cause others to assume you are a beggar.^eccentricities\nClass Features\nArcane Recovery (Level 1)\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.\nYou can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\nSpellcasting (Level 1)\nAs a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See “chapter 10” for the general rules of spellcasting and “chapter 11” for the wizard spell list.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\nSpellbook\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier: your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see “Your Spellbook”).\n\n\n                  \n                  Your Spellbook \n                  \n                \n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\nA spellbook doesn’t contain cantrips.\n. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\nCopying from a Spell Scroll. A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\n. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n. The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n\n\n\nArcane Tradition (Level 2)\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition from the list of available traditions, shaping your practice of magic. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 4)\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nArcane Tradition feature (Level 6)\nAt 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 8)\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nArcane Tradition feature (Level 10)\nAt 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 12)\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nArcane Tradition feature (Level 14)\nAt 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 16)\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nSpell Mastery (Level 18)\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.\nAbility Score Improvement (Level 19)\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nSignature Spells (Level 20)\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/deities/celtic-arawn":{"title":"celtic-arawn","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","deity/celtic","domain/death","domain/life"],"content":"Arawn\nSource: SRD /

Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\nA Question of Enmity\nTwo of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil’s malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn’t be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil’s allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally.

In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nSun\nYou gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\nMoon\nYou are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\nStar\nIncrease one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.\nComet\nIf you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\nThe Fates\nReality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\nThrone\nYou gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nKey\nA rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\nKnight\nYou gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\nGem\nTwenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\nTalons\nEvery magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.\nThe Void\nThis black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\nFlames\nA powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\nSkull\nYou summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.\nIdiot\nPermanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\nDonjon\nYou disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\nRuin\nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\nEuryale\nThe card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\nRogue\nA nonplayer character of the DM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.\nBalance\nYour mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\nFool\nYou lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\nJester\nYou gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/demon-armor":{"title":"demon-armor","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/remove-curse"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/dmg","item/armor/heavy","item/attunement/required","item/rarity/very-rare","item/tier/major"],"content":"Demon Armor\nHeavy Armor, major, very rare (requires attunement)\n\nArmor Class: 18\nProperties: Requires Attunement\nStrength: Requires 15 STR.\nStealth: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.\nCost: ⏤\nWeight: 65.0 lbs.\n\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\nOnce the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/iron-flask":{"title":"iron-flask","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/identify","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/vrock","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/hezrou","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/nalfeshnee","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/marilith","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/balor","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/celestial/deva","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/erinyes","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/imp","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/night-hag","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/celestial/planetar","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/elemental/salamander","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/celestial/solar","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/fiend/succubus","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/bestiary/elemental/xorn"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/dmg","item/rarity/legendary","item/tier/major","item/wondrous"],"content":"Iron Flask\nWondrous Item, major, legendary\n\nCost: ⏤\nWeight: 1.0 lbs.\n\nThis iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.\nYou can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.\nAn identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined

When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat’s name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.\nRandom Properties\nAn Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n\n2 minor beneficial properties\n1 minor detrimental property\n1 major detrimental property\n\nSpells\nThe orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons\nWhile you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb\nAn Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons.

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons\nYou can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head (you choose the type of sword).\nIf you press button 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify\nWhile holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there.

Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\nStatistics for Objects\nWhen time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\nArmor Class\nAn object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n\nHit Points\nAn object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n\nHuge and Gargantuan Objects\nNormal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\nObjects and Damage Types\nObjects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\nDamage Threshold\nBig objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.\nStatblock\ntitle: Generic Object\n![](compendium/bestiary/null/token/generic-object.png#token)\n*Varies Generic*\n \n \n- **Speed** \n \n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n||\n \n \n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/objects/objects":{"title":"objects","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/objects/generic-object"],"tags":[],"content":"Index of Objects\n\nGeneric Object\n"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/agonizing-blast":{"title":"agonizing-blast","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/eldritch-blast"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/ei"],"content":"Agonizing Blast\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/archery":{"title":"archery","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/fs-f","optional-feature/fs-r"],"content":"Archery\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/armor-of-shadows":{"title":"armor-of-shadows","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/mage-armor"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/ei"],"content":"Armor of Shadows\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nYou can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/ascendant-step":{"title":"ascendant-step","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/levitate"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/ei"],"content":"Ascendant Step\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/beast-speech":{"title":"beast-speech","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/ei"],"content":"Beast Speech\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nYou can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/beguiling-influence":{"title":"beguiling-influence","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/rules/skills"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/ei"],"content":"Beguiling Influence\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills."},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/optional-features/bewitching-whispers":{"title":"bewitching-whispers","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/compulsion"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","optional-feature/ei"],"content":"Bewitching Whispers\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it.

While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\nTargeted Effects\nSpells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic\nThe area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\nSpells\nAny active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items\nThe properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel\nTeleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.\nAntipathy\nThe enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\nSympathy\nThe enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\nEnding the Effect\nIf an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\nSummary\nClasses: Druid, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/arcane-eye":{"title":"arcane-eye","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/rules/senses","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/wizard","spell/level/4","spell/school/divination"],"content":"Arcane Eye\n4th-level, Divination\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, a bit of bat fur\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\nFlood\nYou cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25% chance chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\nPart Water\nYou cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\nRedirect Flow\nYou cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\nWhirlpool\nThis effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\nSummary\nClasses: Cleric, Druid, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/control-weather":{"title":"control-weather","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/cleric","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/druid","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/cleric","spell/class/druid","spell/class/wizard","spell/level/8","spell/school/transmutation"],"content":"Control Weather\n8th-level, Transmutation\n\nCasting time: 10 minute\nRange: Self (5-miles radius)\nComponents: V, S, burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hour\n\nYou take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.

If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes\nWhen triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph\nYou can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.\nSummary\nClasses: Bard, Cleric, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/goodberry":{"title":"goodberry","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/druid","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/ranger"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/druid","spell/class/ranger","spell/level/1","spell/school/transmutation"],"content":"Goodberry\n1st-level, Transmutation\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, a sprig of mistletoe\nDuration: Instantaneous\n\nUp to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration.

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\nClasses: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/mass-cure-wounds":{"title":"mass-cure-wounds","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/cleric","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/druid"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/bard","spell/class/cleric","spell/class/druid","spell/level/5","spell/school/evocation"],"content":"Mass Cure Wounds\n5th-level, Evocation\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\n\nA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range.

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM’s choice).\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\nClasses: Cleric\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/planar-binding":{"title":"planar-binding","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/magic-circle","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/cleric","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/druid","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/bard","spell/class/cleric","spell/class/druid","spell/class/wizard","spell/level/5","spell/school/abjuration"],"content":"Planar Binding\n5th-level, Abjuration\n\nCasting time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes\nDuration: 24 hour\n\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service.

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on a prismatic wall.\nRed\nThe creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\nYellow\nThe creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\nGreen\nThe creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\nBlue\nThe creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\nIndigo\nOn a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\nViolet\nOn a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer blinded.

Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.\nClasses: Bard, Cleric\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/speak-with-plants":{"title":"speak-with-plants","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/entangle","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/druid","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/ranger"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/bard","spell/class/druid","spell/class/ranger","spell/level/3","spell/school/transmutation"],"content":"Speak with Plants\n3rd-level, Transmutation\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-feet radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minute\n\nYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.\nClasses: Bard, Druid,

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nDeath\nEach target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nDiscord\nEach target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\nFear\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\nHopelessness\nEach target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\nInsanity\nEach target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\nPain\nEach target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\nSleep\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\nStunning\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.\nSummary\nClasses: Bard, Cleric, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter":{"title":"tashas-hideous-laughter","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/bard","spell/class/wizard","spell/level/1","spell/school/enchantment"],"content":"Tasha’s Hideous Laughter\n1st-level, Enchantment\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\nClasses: Bard, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/telekinesis":{"title":"telekinesis","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/sorcerer","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/sorcerer","spell/class/wizard","spell/level/5","spell/school/transmutation"],"content":"Telekinesis\n5th-level, Transmutation\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minute\n\nYou gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\nOn Target\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\nOff Target\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\nSimilar Area\nYou and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\nMishap\nThe spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\nSummary\nClasses: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/teleportation-circle":{"title":"teleportation-circle","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/bard","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/sorcerer","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/wizard"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/bard","spell/class/sorcerer","spell/class/wizard","spell/level/5","spell/school/conjuration"],"content":"Teleportation Circle\n5th-level, Conjuration\n\nCasting time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes\nDuration: 1 round\n\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nMany major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\nYou allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\nYou grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\nYou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33% chance chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.\nClasses: Sorcerer, Wizard\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/word-of-recall":{"title":"word-of-recall","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/classes/cleric"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/phb","spell/class/cleric","spell/level/6","spell/school/conjuration"],"content":"Word of Recall\n6th-level, Conjuration\n\nCasting time: 1 action\nRange: 5 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\n\nYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.

The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit\nThis pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open (determine the cover’s statistics using the guidelines in chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see.\nIn some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit\nThis pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/traps-hazards/poison-darts":{"title":"poison-darts","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/rules/skills"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/dmg","hazard/mech"],"content":"Poison Darts\nMechanical Trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules"},"5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/traps-hazards/poison-needle":{"title":"poison-needle","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/rules/skills","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/items/thieves-tools"],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/dmg","hazard/mech"],"content":"Poison Needle\nMechanical Trap\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open.

A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle.\nA successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock.

Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n \nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus&#039;s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n \nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their activation.\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Object action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item.\nCommand Word\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can’t be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the silence spell.\nConsumables\nSome items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.\nSpells\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.\nMany items, such as potions, bypass the casting of the spell and confer the spell’s effects. Such an item still uses the spell’s duration unless the item’s description says otherwise.\nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability—perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature—your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.\nCharges\nSome magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained.\nAttack\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the &quot;&quot;Making an Attack&quot;&quot; section for the rules that govern attacks.\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\nSee also: Disarm, Grapple, Mark, Shove, Shove Aside, Two-Weapon Fighting\nCast a Spell\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: Varies\n\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See “chapter 10” for the rules on spellcasting.\nDash\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\nDisengage\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\nDodge\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.\nDon or Doff a Shield\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category. A shield can be donned or doffed as an action.\nEnd Concentration\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: Free\n\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\nEscape a Grapple\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nA grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nSee also: Grapple\nGrapple\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.\nUsing at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nMoving a Grappled Target\nWhen you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\nSee also: Escape a Grapple\nHelp\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\nHide\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in “chapter 7 ” for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the &quot;&quot;Unseen Attackers and Targets&quot;&quot; section in the Player’s Handbook.\nOpportunity Attack\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 reaction\n\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\nOther Activity\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: Varies\n\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\nThe DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\n\n                  \n                  Interacting with Objects Around You \n                  \n                \n\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\n\ndraw or sheathe a sword\nopen or close a door\nwithdraw a potion from your backpack\npick up a dropped axe\ntake a bauble from a table\nremove a ring from your finger\nstuff some food into your mouth\nplant a banner in the ground\nfish a few coins from your belt pouch\ndrink all the ale in a flagon\nthrow a lever or a switch\npull a torch from a sconce\ntake a book from a shelf you can reach\nextinguish a small flame\ndon a mask\npull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\nput your ear to a door\nkick a small stone\nturn a key in a lock\ntap the floor with a 10-foot pole\nhand an item to another character\n\n\n\n\nReady\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in “chapter 10”). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\nYou have until the start of your next turn to use a readied action.\nSearch\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nShove\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\nSee also: Attack, Shove Aside\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 bonus\n\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\nSee also: Attack\nUse an Object\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nDuration: 1 action\n\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn."},"5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions":{"title":"Conditions","links":["5.D-and-D-5e/rules/Conditions","5.D-and-D-5e/compendium/spells/thunderwave"],"tags":[],"content":"Conditions\nBlinded\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nA blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nA charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\nThe charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nConcentration\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\nCasting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.\nTaking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\nBeing incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\n\nThe DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\nDeafened\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nA deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelEffect1Disadvantage on ability checks2Speed halved3Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws4Hit point maximum halved5Speed reduced to 06Death^level-effect\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1.\nFrightened\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nA frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\nThe creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nA grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\nThe condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.\nThe condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.\n\nIncapacitated\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nAn incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\n\nAn invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness.\nSewer Plague\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion.\nOn a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\nSight Rot\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely."},"5.D-and-D-5e/rules/senses":{"title":"senses","links":[],"tags":["compendium/src/5e/mm","compendium/src/5e/phb"],"content":"Senses\nBlindsight\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\nDarkvision\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in that darkness, only shades of gray.\nTremorsense\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nA creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\nTruesight\nSource: SRD / Basic Rules\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\nGoing Mad\nVarious magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the “Player’s Handbook”. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity||Sanity score from  (see chapter 9, “Dungeon Master’s Workshop”), a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.\nMadness Effects\nMadness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.\nA character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.\nA character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.\nA character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.\n\n\n\nCuring Madness\nA calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective.

Kataklizm, który rozpoczął się tak dawno, że większość ludzi zna go tylko z opowieści przodków, postępuje powoli, lecz nieubłaganie. Magiczna ciemność ogarnia kolejne krainy, a światło słońca staje się rzadkością – legenda mówi, że jedynie w jednym odległym, mitycznym miejscu światło wciąż świeci, choć nikt prawie już w to nie wierzy. Większość żyjących ludzi nigdy nie widziała prawdziwego dnia.\nŚwiat musiał przystosować się do nowych, mrocznych warunków. Poszczególne nacje znalazły różne sposoby na przetrwanie w wiecznej nocy: niektóre korzystają z magii światła, inne stworzyły technologiczne cuda, a jeszcze inne uczyniły pakt z mrokiem. To, co kiedyś było codziennością – promienie słońca, cykl dnia i nocy – jest teraz tylko wspomnieniem. Mroczna adaptacja nie uchroniła jednak wszystkich przed straszliwymi skutkami długotrwałego życia w ciemności.\nNa świecie zaczęły pojawiać się magiczne, cieniste istoty, zrodzone z samej ciemności. Te stworzenia, zwane Mrocznymi Włóczęgami, powstają z każdego żywego organizmu, który zbyt długo pozostaje w mroku. Istoty te żywią się esencją światła, którą jest siła witalna każdej żywej istoty. Atakują ludzi, zwierzęta i rośliny, próbując pochłonąć ich witalność, lecz ich głód jest niezaspokojony. Choć nie można ich zabić, światło – zarówno naturalne, jak i magiczne – potrafi je odpędzać, choć tylko na jakiś czas.\nBohaterowie wkraczają do świata na krawędzi upadku. Ciemność jest wszędzie, a maleńkie skrawki światła stają się najcenniejszym skarbem.\nWprowadzenie:\nŚwiat od stuleci pogrąża się w coraz głębszej ciemności, ale niewielu wie, że przyczyną jest powrót starożytnego, zapomnianego boga ciemności — Nūr-Akallu, którego kult, choć dawno unicestwiony, zaczyna odradzać się w tajemnicy. Bohaterowie, nieświadomi prawdziwego źródła klęski, wyruszają na zwykłe zlecenia, badając ruiny i jaskinie, tylko po to, by natknąć się na coś znacznie bardziej złowrogiego.\nPodczas swoich pierwszych przygód drużyna natrafia na różne, niepokojące ślady — na przykład jaskinię, w której odbywa się rytuał ciemności przeprowadzany przez wyznawców zapomnianego boga. Nie rozumieją jeszcze pełnej natury tego, co zobaczyli, ale zdają sobie sprawę, że ma to jakiś związek z kataklizmem trawiącym świat Arcathoru. W kolejnych wyprawach znajdują szczątki tajemniczych inskrypcji i starożytnych symboli związanych z mrokiem, aż w końcu odkrywają niezdefiniowany artefakt, który wydaje się mieć związek z magiczną ciemnością.\nNie wiedząc, co z nim zrobić, bohaterowie udają się do największego miasta w regionie, w nadziei na pomoc. W tym mieście rezyduje potężny mag, znany ze swojej wiedzy o starożytnych tajemnicach. Mag pomaga im zidentyfikować artefakt i ujawnia szokującą prawdę: artefakt jest jednym z kluczy potrzebnych do powstrzymania powrotu Nūr-Akallu. Opowiada im historię dawno zapomnianego bóstwa, które raz już próbowało pogrążyć świat w wiecznej nocy wiele tysięcy lat temu. Teraz jego kult teraz odradza się, dążąc do uwolnienia swojego pana i sprowadzenia ostatecznej ciemności.\nTo odkrycie jest pierwszym krokiem na długiej drodze do powstrzymania nadciągającego kataklizmu. Aby ocalić świat, bohaterowie będą musieli znaleźć więcej artefaktów, zdobyć sojuszników i zmierzyć się z rosnącą siłą kultu ciemności.\nZarys fabuły:\n\nStarodawne proroctwo\nŚwiat Arcathoru był młodym i dzikim miejscem, wciąż nieodkrytym przez żadnych bogów. Żadne wyższe istoty nie rościły sobie prawa do tego nowego świata, co sprawiło, że Arcathor stał się idealnym celem dla istoty o mniejszych ambicjach, lecz potężnym pragnieniu władzy. Nūr-Akallu, bóstwo niższego szczebla, dostrzegł tę okazję i postanowił przejąć kontrolę nad Arcathorem, czerpiąc z niego moc. Aby tego dokonać, musiał jednak przyjąć materialną formę, zniżając się do fizycznej egzystencji, co ograniczało jego boskie zdolności. W tej postaci Nūr-Akallu zaczął siać swoje wpływy wśród ludów Arcathoru, zaszczepiając w nich zalążki kultu ciemności.\n\nNiedługo po tym, jak Nūr-Akallu zaczął tworzyć swoją bazę władzy, jego działania zostały dostrzeżone przez dwoje innych bogów niższego szczebla. Były to istoty dobrej natury, które nie mogły pozwolić, aby świat ten padł łupem mrocznego bóstwa. Oni również postanowili przybyć do Arcathoru, zstępując w formie materialnej, co sprawiło, że byli równi Nūr-Akallu w swoich ograniczeniach. Zrozumieli jednak, że bezpośrednie starcie z bóstwem ciemności może zakończyć się katastrofą, dlatego postanowili zawiązać sojusze z rasami zamieszkującymi ten świat, aby zjednoczyć siły przeciwko nadciągającemu mrokowi.\nTymczasem Nūr-Akallu, korzystając z chaosu, jaki zasiały jego działania, sprzymierzył się z jedną z ras Arcathoru, która była najbardziej podatna na jego wpływy i została omamiona wizją potęgi, którą uzyskałaby dzięki jego mocy. Tak na prawdę chciał ich tylko wykorzystać do osiągnięcia swojego celu (szczegóły tej rasy do uzupełnienia). Razem stworzyli potężną armię, której celem było podporządkowanie sobie wszystkich, którzy mogliby stanowić zagrożenie dla panowania mrocznego bóstwa. Wojna zaczęła przetaczać się przez krainy Arcathoru, niszcząc wszystko na swojej drodze, a każdy, kto nie chciał stać się sługą Nūr-Akallu, był zabijany lub przemieniany w Mrocznego Włóczęgę.\nDwoje dobrych bogów, w desperackiej próbie powstrzymania Nūr-Akallu, zjednoczyło wszystkie pozostałe rasy w koalicję przeciwko mrocznemu bóstwu. Rozpoczęła się Wielka Wojna – konflikt, który miał zdecydować o przyszłości Arcathoru. Na czele swoich armii bogowie poprowadzili swoich śmiertelnych sojuszników przeciwko Nūr-Akallu i jego ciemnym legionom. Wojna była długa i krwawa, ale ostatecznie doszło do decydującej bitwy, podczas której wszyscy trzej bogowie, w swoich fizycznych formach, starli się na polu walki.\nW ostatniej, decydującej bitwie wielkiej wojny dwóm dobrym bogom udało się pokonać fizyczną formę Nūr-Akallu. Choć ich zwycięstwo było trudne i okupione wielkimi stratami, zdołali zniszczyć jego materialne ciało. Osłabiona, niemal zanikła energia mrocznego bóstwa została uwolniona do sfery astralnej. Jednakże niebezpieczeństwo nie minęło całkowicie – wciąż istniała magiczna więź między zniszczoną fizyczną formą Nūr-Akallu a jego astralną esencją. Ta więź wiązała się z jego sercem, wykonanym z mrocznego kryształu, które pozostało na polu bitwy jako ostatni relikt jego mocy.\nPo wielkiej bitwie, resztki armii Nūr-Akallu rozpierzchły się, a wyznawcy mrocznego boga zostali rozbici. Przez wiele lat tropiono i zabijano uciekających kultystów, by upewnić się, że nie pozostał żaden wierny zwolennik mrocznego boga, który mógłby próbować go przywrócić do życia. Jednak pięciu z nich udało się ukryć. Ci najbardziej oddani słudzy przetrwali i w tajemnicy kultywowali wiarę w swoje bóstwo, utrzymując przy życiu resztki jego energii, która dryfowała w sferze astralnej.\nAby zapewnić przetrwanie kultu i uniknąć wykrycia, ustanowili żelazną zasadę: w jednym momencie mogło być tylko pięciu członków kultu. Nowy członek mógł zostać wprowadzony do kultu dopiero po śmierci jednego z piątki. Dzięki tej dyscyplinie i konspiracji, kultyści przez stulecia operowali w ukryciu, powoli gromadząc wpływy, bogactwa i władzę. Choć ich liczba nigdy nie przekraczała pięciu, zdołali manipulować wydarzeniami i kształtować historię Arcathoru tak, aby wszelkie wspomnienia o wielkiej wojnie i samym Nūr-Akallu zostały zapomniane. Dla mieszkańców Arcathoru ciemność była tylko nieuniknioną częścią życia, a prawdziwe źródło kataklizmu zatarło się w historii.\nW międzyczasie kultyści osiągnęli wysokie pozycje społeczne i każdy z nich zyskał władzę lub majątek na swój sposób, aby mieć znaczące wpływy polityczne, ekonomiczne i militarne na całym świecie. Każdy członek tej tajemniczej piątki działał w cieniu, czekając na moment, gdy mroczne bóstwo znów będzie mogło wkroczyć do sfery fizycznej. W miarę upływu lat ich działania nabierały tempa, a mała, elitarna piątka zaczęła rozrastać się w znacznie większy kult.\nWspółcześnie, kult Nūr-Akallu odzyskał dawną siłę i liczy już wielu członków, choć wciąż działa w głębokiej tajemnicy. Manipulują wydarzeniami na świecie, mając na celu przywrócenie swojego boga. To właśnie oni, poprzez potężny rytuał rozpoczęty przez najpotężniejszą piątkę, sprowadzili powrót magicznej ciemności do Arcathoru. Jednak do zakończenia rytuału i pełnego powrotu mrocznego boga brakuje im jednego kluczowego elementu: odzyskania serca Nūr-Akallu, zamkniętego w starożytnej, zapomnianej świątyni. Bez tego kryształu ich plan nie może się powieść, a bohaterowie staną się ostatnią przeszkodą na drodze do pełnego przebudzenia boga ciemności.\nKapłani i rycerze wierni dwóm dobrym bogom, którzy walczyli po ich stronie, wiedzieli, że bezpieczne uwięzienie serca jest jedynym sposobem, aby zapobiec ponownemu powrotowi Nūr-Akallu do sfery fizycznej. W ukryciu, na miejscu wielkiej bitwy, zbudowali tajemną świątynię, w której przeprowadzili rytuał zamknięcia mrocznego serca. To w tej świątyni, głęboko pod ziemią, kryształowe serce Nūr-Akallu zostało uwięzione, co uniemożliwiło astralnej energii bóstwa ponowne połączenie się z jego fizycznym ciałem i odzyskanie mocy.\nZ biegiem czasu świątynia została pogrzebana głębiej pod warstwami ziemi i zapomniana przez ludy Arcathoru. Jednak serce Nūr-Akallu nadal tam spoczywa, będąc zarówno kluczem do jego ponownego przebudzenia, jak i jedyną barierą powstrzymującą powrót bóstwa.\nMiejsce to współcześnie jest ostatnim miejscem na świecie, gdzie wciąż świeci prawdziwe światło słoneczne, nie dotknięte przez magiczną ciemność. Ostatecznym celem bohaterów w tej kampanii będzie odnalezienie zaginionej świątyni, gdzie pogrzebane jest mroczne serce Nūr-Akallu, i zniszczenie go raz na zawsze, zanim kult bóstwa odkryje jego lokalizację i przywróci go do życia.\n\n\nPotężny artefakt\nBohaterowie odkrywają, że istnieje starożytny artefakt, znany jako “Serce Światłości”, który został stworzony, by powstrzymać Zorathusa podczas ostatniej wojny bogów. Artefakt ten, rozproszony na cztery części, musi zostać odnaleziony i połączony, aby zyskać moc do powstrzymania zaćmienia. Każda z części ukryta jest w innej krainie, chroniona przez potężne istoty lub starożytne zaklęcia.\n\n\n\nSkradziona magia\nBohaterowie spotykają istoty magiczne (np. smoki, duchy lasu), które zaczynają tracić swoje moce w wyniku zanikania światła. Niektóre z nich sprzymierzają się z drużyną, inne stają się wrogami w desperackiej walce o przetrwanie. Bohaterowie muszą zmierzyć się nie tylko z zaćmieniem, ale i z chaosem, który ogarnia krainy, gdy magiczne istoty zaczynają walczyć między sobą.\n\nWrogowie:\n\n\nKult Zorathusa: Główna organizacja antagonistów, która zyskuje na sile w miarę jak ciemność ogarnia kolejne ziemie. Kult ukrywa swoje cele, ale jego członkowie sabotują starania bohaterów na każdym kroku. Ich lider, nekromanta Morven, posiada wiedzę o rytuale, który uwolni Zorathusa, i nie cofnie się przed niczym, by go wykonać.\n\n\nTwory cienia: Z czasem, z ciemności zaczynają wychodzić istoty, które wcześniej były uwięzione w wymiarze cienia. Są to mroczne duchy, demony i potwory, które wykorzystują zaćmienie, by atakować świat materialny. Niektóre z tych stworzeń można zniszczyć tylko za pomocą światła lub magii, którą bohaterowie muszą zdobyć.\n\n\nZorathus (główny antagonista): Uwięziony od tysiącleci bóg ciemności, który powoli odzyskuje moc. Na początku kampanii bohaterowie słyszą o nim jedynie jako o legendzie, ale z czasem odkrywają, że jego obecność zaczyna się materializować w świecie poprzez mroczne zaćmienia i dziwne zjawiska. Ostateczna walka z Zorathusem może być zwieńczeniem kampanii – gdzie bohaterowie muszą zdecydować, jak go pokonać: czy użyją artefaktu, czy złożą ofiarę, czy też może spróbują zawrzeć pakt z ciemnością?\n\n\nGłówne wątki:\n\n\nPoszukiwanie artefaktów: Każda część artefaktu “Serce Światłości” jest ukryta w innym regionie – np. w królestwie podziemnych krasnoludów, w lodowych ruinach na dalekiej północy, w pustynnych piramidach, czy w podwodnej świątyni.\n\n\nSojusznicy i wrogowie: Bohaterowie będą musieli negocjować sojusze z różnymi frakcjami – od magicznych gildii po plemiona barbarzyńców, które zostały dotknięte przez mrok. Różne frakcje mogą mieć własne motywacje, które wprowadzą elementy polityki i intrygi.\n\n\nMroczna magia: Drużyna odkryje różne formy ciemnej magii, które pojawiają się w wyniku zaćmienia. Mogą to być starożytne zaklęcia, które pozwalają na kontrolowanie cienia, ale mają swoje koszty. Magowie mogą być kuszeni, by korzystać z mocy cienia, ryzykując swoją duszę.\n\n\nZmiana świata: W miarę jak ciemność ogarnia coraz większe tereny, świat zaczyna się zmieniać. Krainy dotknięte mrokiem są coraz bardziej nieprzyjazne, a bohaterowie muszą zmagać się z coraz trudniejszymi warunkami, co wprowadza elementy przetrwania do kampanii.\n\n\nZakończenie:\nW wielkim finale bohaterowie staną przed ostatecznym wyborem: czy zniszczyć Zorathusa raz na zawsze, czy może spróbować znaleźć inną drogę, która mogłaby przynieść balans między światłem a ciemnością. W zależności od ich decyzji, losy świata mogą się drastycznie zmienić. Jeśli zawiodą, wieczna noc ogarnie świat, a kampania zakończy się mrocznym finałem, w którym gracze będą musieli żyć z konsekwencjami swoich wyborów."},"Test":{"title":" Test","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"title":"Welcome to Quartz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a blank Quartz installation.\nSee the documentation for how to get started."}}
